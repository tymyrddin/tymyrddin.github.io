Scenario planning is a way of [studying tracks](https://tymyrddin.github.io/ancient-practice/) for understanding the dynamics that might shape the future. It's basic choreography:

* Pin down a [decision focus](#decision-focus) to prevent the choreography from degenerating into purposeless speculation about all infinite futures.
* Identify [forces](#forces) that ordinarily work well outside our concerns and usually catch us unaware.
* Identify [predetermined elements](#predetermined-elements), forces that are completely outside our control and will play out in any story we tell about the future.
* Gather [resources](#resources) for further research of elements for developing scenario logics.
* Develop [scenario logics](#scenario-logics) for exploring critical uncertainties and for finding desired deviations from official futures to work backwards from.
* Flesh out [stories](#stories) for putting some meat on those bones.

## Decision focus

Scenario planning works best “inside out” rather than “outside in”. Begin with wording the important decisions that must be made and progress outward to the environment. Revisit the focus regularly, and make changes if necessary.

For example:

_Changes in targets and threats outside the organisation are shaping the risk and security landscape. Visibility into these anticipated changes will help people identify the necessary future security and risk policies and practices and support services for themselves and/or their clients._

## Forces

The point of listing the driving forces is to look past the everyday crises that typically occupy our minds and explore long-term forces that ordinarily work well outside our concerns. It is these powerful forces that will usually catch us unaware.

For example:

_Organisations have traditionally been the target, but sophisticated threats are increasingly occurring via soft targets in individuals — individuals who are employees or volunteers of the organisation, people associated with the organisation, or its clients. Examples of individuals as the target include smartphone vulnerability exploitation and spear phishing for executive credentials._

_Historically, governments use regulation to influence corporate behaviour (see GDPR for example), but increasingly, collectives of like-minded entities banding together drive organisational and individual behaviour. Examples of such collectives are (nation-state-sponsored) hacking groups._

_Every organization in the world, whether in the public or private sector, depends on third-party software, which can include a wide-range of applications. Many of these programs were developed by small vendors that didn't have security in mind. And that includes the software used for developing and distributing software._

_The lines between state-sponsored actors and privately-driven actors in hacking groups and in re-identification practices are increasingly becoming blurred. The impact of exploit proliferation as threat actors use commodity tools such as (open source) penetration-testing software and poisoned update packages to breach networks is likely to be immense._

## Resources

For listing more driving forces for a particular organisation and context, explore for example, [systematic hacking](https://github.com/tymyrddin/orchard/tree/main/trees), hacking forensics, [adversary-centric threat modelling](https://github.com/tymyrddin/orchard/tree/main/threat-modelling), and research into current digital events.Scenario planning is a way of [studying tracks] for understanding the dynamics that might shape the future. The basic choreography:

## Scenario logics

The predetermined elements can be used to set up the logics and critical uncertainties can be found by identifying and removing predetermined elements from the list of forces, and placed within that framework.

The logics spans up spaces to think things through, to do more research, and to come up with possible (counter) moves if a particular scenario does seem to play out. And right in the centre lies “obliviousness and congruence”, containing what is generally overlooked. 

* Research to make sure these are all critical uncertainties.
* Enumerate likely effects.
* What-if ...?
* Determine possible deviations from the official future to work backwards from. 

## Stories

A good set of scenarios will contain two to five different narratives. More than five scenarios tend to get confused with one another. Three scenarios run the danger that people will try to pick the most moderate or most apparently plausible and ignore the other two.

## Examples

* Obliviousness and congruence
* Surveillance society
* Interventions by governments
* Hacker groups rule
* Self-organising (protection) societies
