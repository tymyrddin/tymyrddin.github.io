We have a tendency to believe that we see reality and that what we think is true,  and we have difficulty seeing the self-created paradigms through which we view our world. As a result, we have blind spots that prevent us from seeing things as clearly as we would like (while we think we do).

In order to start seeing our blind spots, we need to become more aware and realise that our inner thought world resembles a tree, or going down a rabbit hole, or that it is turtles all the way down, or elephants all the way down, or 4 elephants standing on a turtle which is flying through space ... 

_Great A'Tuin, the World Turtle, is the gigantic turtle upon whose back the Discworld is carried through space. The Disc does not rest directly on A'Tuin; instead, it rests on the shoulders of four immense elephants, Berilia, Tubul, Great T'Phon and Jerakeen, who stand atop the turtle's shell ... Many things remain unknown about Great A'Tuin, including its gender and desires ..._

If we use the metaphor of a tree, we can believe the trunk of the tree represents the foundation of our belief system and that it was formed during early experiences in life. If we use elephants and turtles, we believe we will never be able to see reality as it is, but it can be fun trying. Hence we chose the latter, because "it" all starts with creating time-space, in which we develop our virtuality headset. 

Meanwhile, on Earth, there are related yet non-galactic [elephants]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/categories/#elephants) in the room. Elephants which people are trying to ignore, for example climate change, or humanities' ravenous runs on resources and its underlying fear of death, the subsequent injustices and inequalities, and wars, to just mention a few.
