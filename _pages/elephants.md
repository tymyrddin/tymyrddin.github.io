We have a tendency to believe that we see reality and that what we think is true,  and we have difficulty seeing the self-created paradigms through which we view our world. As a result, we have blind spots that prevent us from seeing things as clearly as we would like (while we think we do).

In order to start seeing our blind spots, we need to become more aware and realise that our inner thought world resembles a tree, or going down a rabbit hole, or that it is turtles all the way down, or elephants all the way down, or 4 elephants standing on a turtle which is flying through space ... 

If we use the metaphor of a tree, we can believe the trunk of the tree represents the foundation of our belief system and that it was formed during early experiences in life. If we use [elephants or turtles]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/elephants/entangling-conscious-agents), we believe we will never be able to see reality as it is, but it can be fun trying ...

We chose elephants on a turtle flying through space, because it all starts with making time-space in our headset, and because on earth there are other [elephants]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/categories/#elephants) in the room people are trying to ignore, like humanities' ravenous runs on resources, legalised by the arrogation of earth's resources and subsequent commodification, painful inequality, and [fear of death]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/elephants/immortality-inc) underlying it all.
