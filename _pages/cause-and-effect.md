Systems thinking revolves around understanding correlations, causes and effects and is more than just a handy collection of tools and methods to explore complex systems with – it is also an underlying philosophy, an awareness of the role of structure (our own headset) in creating what we face, of that which gets often overlooked, of powerful patterns operating on us, and of consequences of our actions. 

## Diagrams of effects

Diagrams of effects (DOE) visualize a record that we can use to compare what we thought would happen with what actually happened, giving us a starting point for improving our models (or shredding them and starting anew). In the diagrams used here there is space for nebulous items, phenomenologically observables that may or may not be measurable (preferably they are), so that the right hemisphere can add and correct for potential blind spots.

### Components

* An oval represents a measurable variable.
* A cloud represents an observable variable. Its quantity may not be measured, but could be if it were worth the cost. If it becomes quantifiable it becomes an oval.
* An arrow between nodes indicates a relationship between the two variables. The A node has an effect on the B node if the base of the arrow is at A and the head of the arrow at B:
  * If there is no dot on the arrow, it means that if A moves in a direction, B moves in the same direction.
  * If there is a dot on the arrow, it means that if A moves in one direction, B moves in the opposite direction.
  * If there is a black/white square on the arrow, it means a decision-maker can make a choice that has effect on the effect.
  * If there are two parallel lines on the arrow, it means a delayed response.
* If the diagram contains that if A increases → B increases and if B increases → A increases, it is called a self-reinforcing system, and will continue to grow (or decline) until some system limit comes into play and ends the self-reinforcing action (and sometimes the entire system).

Like so:

### Basic choreography

* Brainstorm all the measurable and observable factors in the context.
* Give each the type of node (oval or cloud) on post-its. Put post-its on sheet of paper.
* Look for relationships between the variables. Draw arrows.
* Voilà, a first diagram that helps see the big picture (and more of the whole).
* Look for reinforcing loops. Brainstorm interventions to change the effects.
* For each intervention, brainstorm measurable and observable factors that might have an effect on the intervention. Check how those relate to the measurables and observables in the original diagram.

### Tips

* A relationship between two factors is not necessarily linear.
* Do not be blind to effects that manifest after a time-delay. Those yummy “unexpected” backlashes …
