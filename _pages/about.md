If you are looking for third-party independents for security research and analysis or for [audits, pentesting, red teaming or colourful campaigning](https://github.com/tymyrddin/orchard/wiki/Types-of-pentesting), you have come to the right place! 

We also learn fast and are updating our (relatively) ancient programming and computer science skills for the current internet time-space. We're currently out in space for building sites with JavaScript and/or Ruby, and Data Science with Python.
