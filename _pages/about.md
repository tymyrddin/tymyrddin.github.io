If you are looking for third-party independents for security research and analysis or for [audits, pentesting, red teaming or colourful campaigning](https://github.com/tymyrddin/orchard/wiki/Types-of-pentesting), you have come to the right place! 

## Who we are

We are a group of varying composition. Some are old hands, some want to learn pentesting/red teaming, others want to find (new) solutions to (new) problems. All believe in [open security](https://github.com/tymyrddin/orchard) (instead of job security, but we would like to be able to pay our bills). 

We're currently out in space for building sites with JavaScript and/or Ruby, and researching and doing some data science with Python. 

## Preferred clients

* (W)HRD, Land, Nature and Earth rights defenders.
* Small NGO organisations which are working to protect freedoms as described in the ICCPR and/or digital privacy as described in the GDPR, or in [Ferdinand von Schirach's proposed additional articles](https://www.lto.de/recht/hintergruende/h/eu-grundrechte-charta-projekt-jeder-mensch-schirach-klinger-karpenstein-eugh-umweltschutz-digitalisierung-grundrechtsklage/) (Sorry, is in German, in English these are still a blindspot).
* Small businesses and independents with a focus on autonomy enhancing products and services, for example on passing on permaculture practices or on supporting equally privileged, equipotent participants in collaborative goals.

## Price

We set a not-for-profit price point for NGO's, and for everybody else our price is negotiable and depends on state and purpose of client and our own personal (financial) states. In some cases where lives are at stake and people are already marginalised to the point of having no resources at all, for example in the case of land right defenders for whom there is no funding available, our service can even be for free. And in all cases, if learning is required to provide a service, in no way does a client ever pay for such learning hours, only for the actual service.

Selling without the siren song of certainty is a hard sell, not an impossible sell. Those that want to pay a lot for (false) feelings of certainty and security based on impressive on-the-spot headset wizardry are better off elsewhere.
