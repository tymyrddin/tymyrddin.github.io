If you are looking for third-party independents for security research and analysis or for [audits, pentesting, red teaming or colourful campaigning](https://github.com/tymyrddin/orchard/wiki/Types-of-pentesting), you have come to the right place! 

We are a group of varying composition. Some are old hands, some want to learn pentesting/red teaming, others want to find solutions to new problems. All do it on an independent basis.

Our preferred clients are:

* (W)HRD, Land, Nature and Earth rights defenders.
* Small NGO organisations which are working to protect freedoms as described in the ICCPR and/or digital privacy as described in the GDPR.
* Small businesses and independents with a focus on autonomy enhancing products and services, for example on passing on permaculture practices or on supporting equally privileged, equipotent participants in collaborative goals.

We're currently out in space for building sites with JavaScript and/or Ruby, and researching and doing some Data Science with Python.

If you wish to know more, [contact us](https://tymyrddin.space/#contact-us).
