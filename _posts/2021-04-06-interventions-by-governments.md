These are some ingredients for one of five possible example [scenario narratives]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/scenario-planning):

## Plot
* Corporations, enterprises and NGO's are targets in this scenario.
* A government attempts to regulate the situation in order to protect the targets and itself.
* All infrastructure becomes critical.
* The targets are held responsible.
* Attacks are perceived as cyber war events.
* Cyber warfare breaks out.

## Likely effects

* Increased cost (capital) for businesses/organisations online.
* Increasingly business resources are focused on compliance with regulation instead of risk assessments for gaining a profit.
* Botnets get taken down.
* More cyber criminals are caught. Opportunity cost for private petty tyrants increases.

## Measurables and observables

* The attack patterns that the (In)Famous data breaches reveal, is one of negligence - only self, no real concern for customers/clients/citizens and the context of the internet. This *invites* government regulation while such vulnerable products do not invite perceptions of sophisticated hacking on infrastructure by other nations and acts of cyberwar that call for counter attacks. On the contrary. The JP Morgan Chase hack is a prime example of immediately perceiving cyberwar after a breach is made known. When discovered in 2014, the media were full of articles on Russian hackers attacking the U.S financial system in retaliation against U.S. government-sponsored sanctions aimed at Russia. As it turns out in 2015, it was a “worldwide hacking ring” with four members, of which one was an American and two were Israeli's. The fourth remains a mystery. That Aaron, after attacking the U.S. Financial system (read "crown jewels"), fled to Russia just weeks before the U.S. issued arrest warrants for him, and then later negotiated with the U.S. to come back home, seems also significant.
* Forming of cyber defence divisions like the NATO Cyber defence, NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, and Cyber Warfare book by Defense One portal
* Emerging infrastructure studies like [Harvard: Cyber War](https://cyber.harvard.edu/cybersecurity/Cyberwar)
* Appearance of International Cyberwar Treaties: Calls for such treaties, intiatives, frameworks made, and discussions on pros and cons, but a treaty like this makes no sense and is extremely unlikely to work in practice as governments continue to invest millions in developing espionage technology to spy on each other, and such targets include allies.
