From the We-pretend-nothing-happened Dept (2013) and the And-again Dept (2014).

Yahoo reported a massive data breach involving 500 million user accounts in September 2016, while knowing an intrusion had occurred way back in 2014. The attack had compromised real names, email addresses, dates of birth and telephone numbers. Yahoo went public with it after the stolen database from the company went on sale on the black market. And only then did the company establish an independent committee to investigate the matter. A tad bit late.

The committee reported that Yahooâ€™s security team and senior executives knew that a state-sponsored actor (?) had hacked certain user accounts back in 2014, that some remedial actions were taken, one of which was notifying 26 users targeted in the hack (hahaha, how many out of 500 million is that?), and another was adding new security features. Some senior executives allegedly failed to comprehend or investigate the matter further.

In 2017, the U.S. Department of Justice indicted two Russian hackers and two Russian spies. The charges were hacking, economic espionage, trade secret theft, wire fraud, and identity theft.

* Investigators said the Russian government used stolen Yahoo data to spy on a range of targets in the United States, including White House and military officials, bank executives and even a gambling regulator in Nevada.
* According to [the indictment](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/us-charges-russian-fsb-officers-and-their-criminal-conspirators-hacking-yahoo-and-millions), some victim accounts were of predictable interest to the FSB, a foreign intelligence and law enforcement service, such as personal accounts belonging to Russian journalists; Russian and U.S. government officials; employees of a prominent Russian cybersecurity company; and numerous employees of other providers whose networks the conspirators sought to exploit. However, other personal accounts belonged to employees of commercial entities, such as a Russian investment banking firm, a French transportation company, U.S. financial services and private equity firms, a Swiss bitcoin wallet and banking firm and a U.S. airline.

Not where the story ends. In December 2016, Yahoo buried the record on the Yahoo 2014 hack with the disclosure that an even earlier breach in 2013, by a different group of hackers had compromised 1 billion accounts. Besides names, dates of birth, email addresses and passwords, in this hack, security questions and answers had also been compromised. And almost a year later, in October of 2017, Yahoo finally admitted that all 3 !!! billion user accounts had been compromised. 

Yahoo offered it clients advice:

* Change your passwords and security questions and answers for any other accounts on which you used the same or similar information used for your Yahoo account;
* Review all of your accounts for suspicious activity;
* Be cautious of any unsolicited communications that ask for your personal information or refer you to a web page asking for personal information;
* Avoid clicking on links or downloading attachments from suspicious emails;
* Consider using Yahoo Account Key, a simple authentication tool that eliminates the need to use a password on Yahoo altogether.

Missing in this list is "consider an alternative to Yahoo", [something Verizon apparently did not do](https://www.mercurynews.com/2017/03/16/verizon-accused-of-aiding-and-abetting-yahoo-executives-by-using-data-breaches-to-save-350-million/).
