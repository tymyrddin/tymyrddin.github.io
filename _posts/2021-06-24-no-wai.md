The [UN Shared Rohingya Data Without Informed Consent](https://www.hrw.org/news/2021/06/15/un-shared-rohingya-data-without-informed-consent) putting the lives of people at risk.

The UN comments on that with a [Statement on refugee registration and data collection in Bangladesh](https://www.unhcr.org/en-us/news/press/2021/6/60c85a7b4/news-comment-statement-refugee-registration-data-collection-bangladesh.html).

What follows is an explosion of articles and statements on the internet, of which many try to save the day on their [data science projects](https://tymyrddin.gitbook.io/orchard/terraforming-threat-modelling/de-anonymisation-threat-modelling/adversaries/data-scientists) by promising change or discussing the necessity for change to address the symptoms of a fundamentally broken system of incentives and accountability.

The system itself remains unaddressed. Thank you Michael, for adressing that it is not being adressed.
