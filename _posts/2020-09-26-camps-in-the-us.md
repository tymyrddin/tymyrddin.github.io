2600 Magazine has compiled a full listing of Customs and Border Patrol stations, a number of which are being used to imprison migrants, immigrants, and/or refugees, many of whom are children. Not every facility in the list (or on the map) is being used for imprisonment, but many existing camps are either at one of these addresses or are being managed there. It is also only a partial list of the total number of camps, as others are operated by different branches of the government, as well as by private companies. 2600 will be updating it as they receive and compile more data. For the listings of ICE detention facilities, organizations running facilities for profit, and ICE collaborators, or for sharing your additional info, go to [Concentration Camps in the U.S](https://concentrationcamps.us/).

If you think it is inappropriate to refer to these as concentration camps, go to [Internment Camps in the U.S](https://internmentcamps.us/).
