This is one of the first publicly documented mobile APT actors known to execute espionage on a global scale. It is believed to be administered out of a building belonging to the Lebanese General Security Directorate in Beirut. At present, we have knowledge of hundreds of gigabytes of exfiltrated data, in 21+ countries, across thousands of victims. According to the [report by lookout](https://info.lookout.com/rs/051-ESQ-475/images/Lookout_Dark-Caracal_srr_20180118_us_v.1.0.pdf), the APT group targeted “entities that a nation-state might attack,” including governments, military personnel, utilities, financial institutions, manufacturing companies, defence contractors, medical practitioners, education professionals, academics, and civilians from numerous other fields. 

The Dark Caracal group seems to not rely on any zero-day exploits, nor on uploading an application with malware to the Google Play Store. The actor has been observed making use of desktop tooling, but has prioritised mobile devices as the primary attack vector and used basic social engineering via posts on Facebook groups and WhatsApp messages, encouraging users to visit a website controlled by the group. Once tricked into landing on the malicious websites, the victims were served fake updates to secure messenger apps, including WhatsApp, Signal, Threema Telegram, and Orbot (an open source Tor client for Android), which eventually downloaded the Dark Caracal malware, dubbed Pallas, on targets' mobile devices.

The Pallas malware family are surveillance malware that are capable of taking photographs, stealing data, spying on communications apps, recording video and audio, acquiring location data, and stealing text messages, including two-factor authentication codes, from victims' devices.
