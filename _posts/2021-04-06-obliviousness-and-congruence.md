These are some ingredients for one of five possible example [scenario narratives]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/scenario-planning):

## Plot

In scenario planning everything is a prediction. None of it is real. All predictions are wrong. And that which gets overlooked in most (if not all) digital scenarios is reality. For example:

* We belong to a finite planet, with finite resources.

## Likely effects

* Constraints on economic development (but not for transnational players in the neoliberal network).
* Corporations and businesses already show a trend of making employees make do with what they have and requests made by employees for better resources (to serve customers with) are ignored, leaving employees in a very difficult place – unable to do their job properly and on top of that, likely to be penalised for ‘poor performance’. This could lead to people feeling burned out and frustrated. Performance will drop as a result and so will demand and profits.
* Instead of dealing with it (just as with addicts facing a scarcity of the resource they are dependent on), over-use of resources, such as the depletion of rain forests and over-fishing can occur.
* Opportunism can increase.
* Misuse of scarce resources is also likely.
* The effect of inflation tends to be stronger for low-income individuals, whom inflation renders relatively more vulnerable, thereby increasing inequality.
* Lack of material resources - chronic (low income) and situational (inflation) lack of material resources - causes people to make harsher moral judgments and be more (often) physically ill.

## Measurables and observables

* Many of the metals needed to feed the surging global demand for high-tech products, from smart phones to solar panels, cannot be replaced, according to a Yale study, [On the materials basis of modern society](https://www.pnas.org/content/112/20/6295)
* The [British Geological Survey (BGS) Risk List](https://www2.bgs.ac.uk/mineralsuk/statistics/riskList.html) states that economically important metals with high levels of risk to supply disruption including antimony (with application as a fire retardant), bismuth (used in numerous medical applications), platinum group metals (active components in auto-catalysts), and tungsten (a key hard metal used in most cutting tools), particularly the rare earth elements and antimony, have low recycling rates and a limited number of substitutes. They are also almost exclusively mined as by-product metals. 
* The minimum total power that was required to run (wall socket power) and maintain (embody) the internet in 2017 was guesstimated to be somewhere between ~131 GW + ~167 GW = ~298 GW and ~204 GW + ~288 GW = ~492 GW.
