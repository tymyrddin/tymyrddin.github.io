The term [military-industrial complex](https://www.militaryindustrialcomplex.com/) was first used by U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower in his Farewell Address on January 17, 1961. The Military-industrial complex is supposedly a network of individuals and institutions involved in the production of weapons and military technologies attempting to marshal political support for continued or increased military spending by a national government. It can also be defined as “an informal and changing coalition of groups with vested psychological, moral, and material interests in the continuous development and maintenance of high levels of weaponry, in preservation of colonial markets and in military-strategic conceptions of internal affairs.”. Apparently it is made up of tens of thousands of contributors spanning the globe. 

What if Noam Chomsky's suggestion that “military–industrial complex” is a misnomer because the phenomenon in question is “not specifically military” is right on the dot? What if it is still “the industrial system operating under one or another pretext where defence was a pretext for a long time)”?

What if the pretext is still defence, but “the complex” has adapted to using new forms of control to further its own interests?

What if the biggest bad wolf is us believing we are “free” (to post our information (and shadow information)) using obsolescence-ready dishwasher-safe 4G-accelerated technology?
