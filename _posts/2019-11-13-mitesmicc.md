What if Noam Chomsky's suggestion that “military–industrial complex” is a misnomer because the phenomenon in question is “not specifically military” is right on the dot? What if it is still “the industrial system operating under one or another pretext where defence was a pretext for a long time)”?

What if the pretext is still defence, but “the complex” has adapted to using new forms of control to further its own interests?

What if the biggest bad wolf is us believing we are “free” (to post our information (and shadow information)) using obsolescence-ready dishwasher-safe 4G-accelerated technology?
