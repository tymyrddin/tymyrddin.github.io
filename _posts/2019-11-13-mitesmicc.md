The term [military-industrial complex](https://www.militaryindustrialcomplex.com/) was first used by U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower in his Farewell Address on January 17, 1961. Supposedly it is a network of individuals and institutions involved in the production of weapons and military technologies attempting to marshal political support for continued or increased military spending by a national government. 

It can also be defined as _an informal and changing coalition of groups with vested psychological, moral, and material interests in the continuous development and maintenance of high levels of weaponry, in preservation of "free" markets and in military-strategic conceptions of internal affairs_. And apparently it is made up of [tens of thousands of contributors spanning the globe](https://www.militaryindustrialcomplex.com/companies.php). 

What if Noam Chomsky's suggestion is right on the dot, that "militaryâ€“industrial complex" is a misnomer because the phenomenon in question is "not specifically military"? What if it is "the industrial system operating under one or another pretext where defence was a pretext for a long time)"?

What if, ever since early advanced "civilisations", the used pretext is still defence (from some enemy), but "the complex" has adapted to using [new forms of control to further its own interests]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/scenario-planning/who-owns-what)?

>_The more complex communities become, the more differentiated the creation and loss of property becomes. And an alliance is formed that determines the fate of the world from then on: That of wealth and political power. As inseparable siblings, wealth and office rush from century to century. This is how biographies such as those of the Emperor Augustus and many of his successors on the Roman imperial throne came into being._ 

What if the biggest bad wolf is us believing we are "free" (to post our information (and shadow information)) using obsolescence-ready dishwasher-safe 5G-Gen6-accelerated technology?
