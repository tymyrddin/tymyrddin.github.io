Technological advancements allowed state violence to be performed on a greater and more efficient scale, yet stealthy, extremely stealthy, close to formlessness. In fact, if they came for you, you wouldn't see them coming, while they see everything.

As a consequence of some never quite explained crisis, the major powers we associated with political power within the globalised world - The US, China, the EU, and Japan are no more. The world’s governments were replaced by a global “democratic” order in which a variety of corporate and some NGO based political groups compete with one another for electorally generated power.

A plethora of technological developments - facilitating deadlier weapons, genetic modifications resulting in various forms of mutants, new forms of oppression and violence, and a huge inequality gap between people and between what was left of “countries” - appeared. And of course, some hackers saw the apocralypse coming, collaborated to the best of their knowledge, and … built an Alpha Complex underground, to protect its citizens.

Welcome to Yet Another Alpha Complex, an adaptation of the infamous tabletop role-playing game Paranoia, moving it from tables in the US into life size simulations. Why? Because The Computer, still extremely paranoid and buggy, says so. And all of its citizens are its agents - as well as being mutants and members of secret societies and all kinds of intelligence agencies.

## Complex basics
This is where everybody lives. It is a vast self-contained community. Its occupants have never seen Outdoors (except under cover of night if the Complex has to move to another location). Knowledge of Outdoors is treasonous. The complex …

* has minimally three sectors. 
* is mobile, that is to say, minimised in terms of resources that need to be schlepped around to move to yet another physical location. Only that which is locally not available needs to be schlepped. 
* is self-contained: upon arrival people will be assigned to service groups to serve the physical needs of The Computer and its citizens. In other words, The Complex is complex, and we do it to each other.
* can be reset if necessary: with those same machine images, data and tools as we started with.
* is (always) currently under construction.

## Service groups

Everybody in the Alpha Complex belongs to a service group of some description. Some people have a full-time job once the Complex runs, but still have strong links to the Service Group they worked for while building it. Other people are a bit like volunteer firemen - they work in a Service Group most of the time, and go on missions when The Computer needs them.

Either way, a Service Group will determine what skills a person starts out with (and not the other way around, so yes, this is decided for you). The Service Groups are:

### Internal Security 	
IntSec are the (internet) police of Alpha Complex. While some officers openly display the fact they are in IntSec, many are undercover. Hack teams may sometimes have IntSec officers in their midst, but they will always pretend to be from another service group.

### Technical services	
Tech Services are the makers of the Alpha Complex. They tend to have good knowledge of things electrical and digital, like setting up and maintaining the networks, but they are unlikely to know how to reprogram or hack The Computer (before you go getting ideas). The roles of Tech Services and Power Services tend to overlap to some extent.

### Research & Design 	
Throughout history, technological advances have brought with them new (security) challenges, to which every society has had to adapt. The Alpha Complex for example, went underground to protect its citizens, while believing that further technological advancement would continue to improve living conditions in an almost utopian way.

R&D, also known as Research & Design in the Alpha Complex, concerns itself with activities in connection with innovation, although The Computer is very weary of “improvements” applied to itself. Research & Design constitutes the first stage of development of potential new information and communication technology services or products that support the Rule of The Computer.

While Tech Services make things around Alpha Complex, it is R&D who actually invent things in the first place. People from R&D tend to be reasonably good at hacking some things (but are not as skilled as Tech Services engineers), but tend to be better at doing research and coming up with new vulnerabilities and novel ideas than their Tech Services counterparts. 

### CPU 	
The Central Processing Unit looks after the day-to-day running of The Computer, and tends to be rather bureaucratic. Only the highest members of CPU are likely to have any computer programming skills though. Having said that, CPU engineers tend to be skilled at using computer terminals to search for information quickly.

_This page is meant for citizens. It's a bit empty right now, but I hope to include contributions from citizens in the future. You see, the trouble with doing web pages for Paranoia is that most of the really good stuff is for the highest clearances only. I think it's about time lower-clearance citizens had a voice somewhere. I know, I know, I'll be put on the hit list and killed by The Computer for this._

### Power Services	
Power Services look after the amenities (water, electricity, sewage, ventilation, etc) and associated cabling and piping within Alpha Complex. Sometimes a Power Services engineer will know a route out of somewhere (or into somewhere) involving cabling ducts or ventilation shafts.

### PLC	
Production, Logistics and Commissary are responsible for agricultural and industrial production, along with the allocation of resources. Hack teams normally visit PLC to be allocated equipment before going out on a mission.

### Armed Forces 	
The army. Their job is to provide Alpha Complex with military protection.

### HPD&MC 	
The intense negative feelings government bureaucracies evoke in the people caught in their web not only spring from their imposing structures, impersonality, and the murky rules, but are reinforced by the sheer magnitude of the apparatus.

* Directly or indirectly, each bureaucrat relies on the power of government enforcement agencies.
* In a sense, bureaucrats resemble the members of a secret society, a brotherhood of sorts.
* Normal people acting within the framework of a bureaucratic system that has access to modern techniques of action and control.

Enforcement agencies, bureaucrats and citizens fearing being singled out and targeted, are the three elements that combine to enable a bureaucracy to function as a horribly destructive entity whose powers can be directed at any person or group that attracts its attention.

Luckily, the citizens of the Alpha Complex escaped all of that.

In the Alpha Complex, Housing Preservation and Development & Mind Control (HPD&MC) look after the running of Alpha Complex when it comes to the paperwork. The HPD part involves making sure everybody has somewhere to live (and that they've filled out the right forms to get it). The MC part ensures their minds are pure by providing quality (vidscreen) mind-controlling entertainment. Think what it would be like if the bureaucrats ran all the TV stations. That's what HPD & MC is like. 

## Sectors

This document has been classified as Red Clearance. Citizens of Infrared Clearance reading this document should report to the nearest Termination Centre immediately. Stay Happy!

### Sector BAL

Sector BAL is very much balanced between Armed Forces and Research & Design, though the other Service Groups seem to also balance out equally amongst themselves. The sector prides itself on the manufacture and application of new and precisely configured and used tools and kalified (and well defended) PC's. Resident citizens are encouraged to Hack to Learn to the best of their ability. The sector is largely a network of servers and PC's used to test new and ‘tweaked’ tools, plus a few open spaces (connected to the Outdoors). The rest of the sector is comprised of offices, warehouses and residential areas that help maintain the central concerns of the sector.

Sector BAL actually appears quite clean and neat and tidy. Citizens seem to be mentally well-rounded individuals and fit too, although this may be more due to rigorous training and exercise that is encouraged, rather than any sort of brilliant diet. That said, healthy eating is encouraged. The sector is also home to one of the most competent Alpha Complex Gaming teams, ‘The BAL Bots’. Building and testing out bots is the premiere source of entertainment of the BAL bots team, and those citizens that carve out a career as a bot maker in this sector are often expected to do quite well for themselves. 

### Sector CRN

Sector CRN is a pretty much standard sector. Housing a corporate network, and with a generous concentration of Internal Security and HPD & MC inhabitants to ensure that the sector both looks and acts like a well-oiled machine, whilst retaining a stylish and simple appearance, the Sector doesn't particularly stand out other than having lush higher-clearance areas, and apparently a lot of time and money to invest in music and other 'arts'. There does seem to be a concentration of higher clearance personnel (in comparison to other sectors) here, though not so much that the higher clearances out-number the lower clearances. The sector connects to most other sectors and traffic is therefore an occasional problem in the more public areas, and there is a lot of noise, but generally it is the side-effect of a melting pot of different societies. If this was a pre-Old Reckoning city, it might be described as cosmopolitan, though it might appear to be one purely from the eyes of the higher clearance occupants - lower clearance citizen probably don't notice the difference.

### Sector SIM

Sector SIM is largely an entertainment-orientated sector, at least to most citizens. The sector's resources are largely devoted towards the sector's renowned Real Life Surveillance Simulators, a giant Virtual Reality world made of surveillance footage of the other areas, and where citizens (from clearance Red and upwards) can plug in and 'escape' the real world. At the lowest clearances, citizens are able to view the sector BAL vids and data, whilst higher clearances are granted the option of technically detailed surveillance materials.

The rest of the sector is devoted to maintaining the entire internet system needed to run the Complex for many hundreds of citizens at a time. At the higher clearances, where much more free time is available, some citizens practically live in the surveillance game. For lesser citizens, and in particular the Infrared citizens, the sector is much like working in a giant technological amusement park. These citizens are responsible for maintaining the smooth running of the system and public relations with the rest of Alpha Complex. They must be vigilant for Commie tampering and Kali systems operating in the sector.

The sector is shaped very much like a dome. Those plugged into the computer systems do so in cubicles, which are arranged around the central computer system, a dome within the main dome of the sector. Somewhere in the middle is a cubicle that stands out and contains the games' server, there is the SIM Compnode. Meanwhile, at the edges of the sector are the various reception areas, shops, freeways and general public regions of the sector. Beneath the glossy surface of the sector, many levels below, are the essential pipes, electrical works and food vats, which keep the sector going. 

## Facilities

Space:

* Secure space that can hold double the expected attendance (theatre style). This is a minimum; the bigger the better, and hopefully with at least two extra spaces for CRN and SIM. If more extra rooms are available, we'll add a sector.
* It is essential that the main room (sector BAL) has one large blank wall that posters can be affixed to in some way.
* Preferably a quality sound system is available, that can be placed in sector CRN.
* Natural light helps to create a relaxed atmosphere, just before the shit hits the fan.
* A door to the outside world – if the space has doors that lead outside to, for example a garden, it is easier for people to take breaks in the fresh air. And groups and teams may be tempted to use the outdoor space to meet if the weather is co-operative. This is a good thing, and a bad thing. Those that do are traitors.

BAL:

* Laptops and PC's - one per 2 pp
* A couple of tables for laptops
* Chairs - one pp
* A couple of tables for food to be served on.
* One large blank wall kept free of obstacles

SIM:

* Coloured rope or tape to create restricted areas.
* Signage that wards away trespassing.
* Entertainment resources (games, movies, surveillance “tapes” of the other sectors)
* At least 4 tables in the middle of the room to form the (core dome) space for The Computer. The heart of the surveillance network of The Computer.

CRN:

* Comfortable chairs to create lush higher-clearance areas. The IntSec and HPD&MC groups have their home here.
* Coloured rope or tape to create restricted areas.
* Signage that wards away trespassing.
* Sound system, music and art.
* Table for main corporate network router and server.

## Materials

* Flipchart markers, Post-it notes, Flipchart paper, Masking tape, Scissors, Coloured name tags (all clearances), Pens and pads.
* Laptops or other computers and live USB's for various purposes, The Computer (server with webgoat), Corporate Inc.

### Networks

The challenge is not design a network and then get the hardware and software, but build a network from what one finds is available in a location. Like using [CollapseOS]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/elephants/collapse-os)). Hopefully we'll find:

* Surveillance network: Webcams, Microphones, Cables (ethernet and power), Routers, Screens (as big as possible) for playing surveillance “tapes”, Produce “the computer says so” in various locations in the complex
* Corporate network: Service to all PC's in all sectors, No net-neutrality, Cables (ethernet and power), Routers, Access to wireless internet connections

### Propaganda

* Sheets, Leaflets. 
* The Computer says so, made with text-to-speech, randomly produced all over the complex
* Movies
    * THX 1138, a 1971 film by George Lucas depicting life in an underground dystopia where all human activities are monitored centrally at all times. The film was first made as a student project in the University of Southern California and called Electronic Labyrinth: THX 1138 4EB.
    * Metropia is a 2009 English-language Swedish-Danish-Norwegian adult animated mystery thriller drama science fiction film directed by Tarik Saleh. The film uses a technique where photographs have been altered and heavily stylized in a computer program, and then animated. Animation set in a future Europe where the world is running out of oil. A gigantic underground network is created by joining all the undergrounds together beneath Europe.
* Books
    * Infomocracy, by Malka Older (R&D)
    * Der Prozess, by Franz Kafka (HPD&MC)

## The Computer

The Computer runs everything within Alpha Complex. The Computer sees everything within Alpha Complex (well, that's what It would have you believe). Everybody within Alpha Complex works for The Computer, listens to The Computer, serves The Computer, protects The Computer and quite often dies for The Computer. (it's sometimes said [people often die because of The Computer](https://github.com/tymyrddin/orchard/blob/main/threat-modelling/DA-threat-model/impacts/%E2%86%91-Bias-and-discrimination.md), but to say such a thing is treasonous. So it's not said very often.)

Though deranged, The Computer believes it is doing the right thing. It strongly believes that Alpha Complex is in danger of being invaded by Communists (very very bad, that) or Mutants (or even mutant commies), and to this end it invented Troubleshooters, and later also Hackers. Hackers complained they weren't invented by The Computer, but those voices died out pretty fast. 

## Names

The Computer is a bit of a stickler for naming conventions. HPD&MC supports the naming conventions strongly, because it makes everything so much easier. No ambiguities, no duplicates. Every citizen's name contains a first name, their security clearance, the name of the sector they originated from (all sector names are 3 letters long) and their current clone number. Examples:

Ultraviolet Citizens

    Phant-U-SIM-1 - High Programmer
    Eat-U-CRN-1 - High Programmer
    Notwot-U-SIM-1 - High Programmer

Violet Citizens

    Pa-V-SIM-1 - Technical Services
    Broo-V-CRN-1 - HPD&MC

Indigo Citizens

    Intertr-I-BAL-2
    Cann-I-BAL-3
    Div-I-SIM-2

Red Citizens

    Peppe-R-CRN-6

Infrared citizens often leave the security clearance letter from their name, since technically they do not have any security clearance. 

## Security clearances

Everybody has a security clearance. Security clearance is based on colours of the spectrum. Citizens start out with Infrared clearance, which is low as you can get. These citizens wear black uniforms and are typically only allowed in Infrared areas unless specifically authorised by a citizen of a higher clearance.

As time goes on, citizens who don't get terminated can be promoted to a higher clearance. The nine security clearances are Infrared, Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, Violet and Ultraviolet. It is rumoured that there are security clearances above Ultraviolet. Rumours are, as you should know by now, treasonous.

Not surprisingly, those citizens at the top are reluctant to let others rise to their level. Citizens at the top always have a close eye on those below them. Citizens at the same level tend to compete to try to get promoted. Citizens at the bottom tend to try to eliminate those above them (and also the competition) in order to get promoted.

Availability of information is based on security clearance. However, it is not unusual for vital information to be above your security clearance level. For example, in the section on Mutations, you are told that you should report any mutations you find. However, information on mutations is above your current security clearance level. This presents a dilemma - if you report a mutation, how do you explain knowing that it's a mutation?

The Computer takes security very seriously. Citizens found possessing information or belongings, or using digital tools above their clearance will be reprimanded. Citizens in areas, corridors and cubicles above their clearance will also be reprimanded. (Corridors are colour coded). On extreme occasions, infrared citizens have been reprimanded for bleeding a colour above their security clearance. 

## Mutations

Even though modern cloning techniques are perfect (The Computer says so), occasionally a mutation has been known to creep into the genetic material. Although mutations are treasonous, The Computer has been known to overlook mutations if they are reported quickly. From time to time you may see a citizen with a yellow stripe on their uniform. This means they are a Registered Mutant and they have already confessed their mutation to The Computer.

Details of specific mutations are not available at your security clearance. Should you discover that you have a mutation, or you know of an unregistered mutant, you are to report it immediately to The Computer.

If you should hear rumours that mutations are commonplace, you are to report the citizen spreading the rumour immediately. Rumours are treason. 

## Clones

The Computer decided that sex and birth were very inefficient methods of creating citizens. Instead, Alpha Complex produces all of its loyal citizens in clone vats. Six citizens are produced at once, all identical. When If a citizen dies, their next clone is sent by means of a rapid replacement system. In practice, this normally means that a replacement clone turns up within five minutes of The Computer being notified of the death of the previous one.

Despite any evidence to the contrary, everybody believes that a replacement clone is free of any deformities that the previous one may have had (be this a mutation, secret society membership or knowledge of what's really going on). To point out to The Computer that two clones from the same batch have mutations is a bad idea unless you have very good evidence to back this claim up. The Computer doesn't make that kind of mistake. 

## Communism

The Computer believes that Communists are its greatest threat. While it is tolerant of mutants (so long as they register themselves) and some secret societies (certainly those ones which believe that The Computer is doing a good job - although “tolerant” may be too strong a word for it), It is not tolerant of Communists.

Should you discover you are a Communist, you are advised to terminate yourself. It would be a lot less painful than anything The Computer would have in mind.

## Secret societies

Some poor misguided citizens feel that The Computer does not provide them with enough guidance or leadership. They feel that membership of a highly illegal Secret Society is the only way to progress. These misguided citizens join secret societies for many different reasons. Some feel that The Computer should be doing things differently, or that The Computer should be overthrown, or that mutants should be stamped out (even registered ones), or that The Computer is doing a wonderful job and should be protected because hackers aren't effective enough.

Membership of a secret society is - you guessed it - treasonous. 

## Hackers

Your character is a hacker. This elite band of citizens (groups vary in size from 2 to 6, although groups are sometimes bigger) are supposed to gain access to and exploit systems. Sometimes they hack themselves, sometimes they hack team member systems. It is not unusual for an entire team to hack itself to pieces in a display of devoted loyalty to The Computer. (At least, that's what The Computer would like to believe it was).

Invariably what happens is that some or all of the citizens belong to secret societies, who have given them instructions which quite often contradict the orders they were given in a mission. Add some mutations to this mix (ones which would actually be useful, but the citizens dare not use them for fear of being terminated for being an unregistered mutant), and you start to see how silly a typical mission can be.

Start worrying. 

## Missions

Missions can involve almost anything, almost all of which are designed to keep people occupied, entertained and killed. For instance:

* Hunting suspected mutants.
* Hunting members of secret societies. This gets more complicated when you're supposed to hunt your own secret society.
* Exploring or gathering resources from the Outdoors, the area outside Alpha Complex. Knowledge of Outdoors is treasonous and punishable by death, although that rarely stops the Computer from sending people there anyways … and then killing them for actually having done so.
* Testing weapons, software, equipment, gadgets and things from the R&D division. Since the most widely available soda in Alpha Complex actually explodes if it is shaken too hard, you can imagine how dangerous this stuff usually ends up being.
* Hacking Corporation Inc. We all depend on the corporate network and server(s), therefore it is important to keep an eye on it and its people.

Mission outline:

* Hackers normally get a mission alert first. This is a printed sheet of paper which tells them where to report for their briefing. Sometimes the mission alert will also give a few details of the mission. Occasionally these details may even be correct.
* Once the team has found their briefing space and briefing officer, they are given details of their mission. Missions normally involve a report of some hack somewhere. The Hackers normally have to gain access, find a piece of information, sometimes exploit a vulnerability if possible, and report on the mission.
* Having been briefed, the Hackers head off to PLC (Production, Logistics and Commissary) for some equipment. This will normally include PC's and/or USB sticks and various other things which The Computer thinks are appropriate for the mission. (Although the Hackers will often find that PLC has lumbered them with stuff they simply want to get rid of).
* Next it's off to R&D (Research & Design) for some experimental equipment. The Computer believes that R&D is a valuable department and that they should be encouraged. While R&D do a lot of their work in the lab, there is no substitute for field testing. Hacker teams are well suited for this sort of work since they are facing new challenges every day anyway. (It's rumoured that a high-clearance citizen in IntSec managed to convince The Computer that Hacker teams were better suited to R&D testing than members of IntSec).
* Now it's time for the Hackers to go off on their mission. Sometimes they never get this far, having managed to lose most of their clones on the way to R&D (or sometimes while in R&D).
* Eventually the citizens will return from their mission (or more likely get wiped out). Should they return, they report and are debriefed. This quite often turns into a finger-pointing session where Hackers blame each other for various failures during the mission. Traitors are terminated. Loyal citizens are rewarded with credits, promotion, or both. Needless to say, this is rare.

There are a lot of tales going around about the past and its missions. Do not participate in such rumouring. It is forbidden. If you do, you'll be designated a conspirationalist, and worse, belonging to a secret society. Besides, these stories are not true.

### Clones have no memory of experiences of previous clones

A hacker got killed by being pushed down an incinerator chute. His replacement turned up with no memory of what had happened. The mission continued. The citizen later made the rather unfortunate mistake of saying to a team-mate “Why should I trust you? You pushed my last clone down the incinerator”. A brief discussion followed, where the clone was asked how he could possibly know that. This was followed by accusations of mutation and a (brief) firefight. The next clone turned up a few minutes later. The citizen wasn't impressed.

### Not going anywhere fast

In our mission team we had a citizen who was completely new. Just about 20% into the mission he was already onto his 5th clone, 2 of these were lost during the mission briefing. I won't go through how he lost all of his clones but just 1 in particular. After his first 4 clones had died most horribly, his 5th one rejoined the mission:

Right, now I'm angry because you lot have just killed of all my clones and you lot are still on your first clones! How do you know that we killed all your clones? I don't know, I must have some sort of psychic connection with them or something! Mutant! *ZAP ZAP* Frazzle frazzle *smell of fried hacker* Let that be a lesson.
