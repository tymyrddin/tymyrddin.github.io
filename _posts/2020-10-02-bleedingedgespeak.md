With the sophistication of the brain circuitry adapted to the human capacity for more congruent linguistic expression, we can assist ourselves and others by making words and meanings that help make conversations easier and more comfortable. But, don't take my word for it.

[Newspeak](https://web.archive.org/web/20130217000821/http://www.newspeakdictionary.com/ns-prin.html) is the language of Oceania, a fictional totalitarian state and the setting of the novel Nineteen Eighty-Four. Bleedingedgespeak is the language of the world now, a not-so-fictional-yet-globalised-virtual state.

* The [A vocabulary](#a-vocabulary) of Bleedingedgespeak contains everyday words and phrases.
* The [B vocabulary](#b-vocabulary) contains all words with political or ideological significance.
* The [C vocabulary](#c-vocabulary) encompasses words that relate specifically to science and to technical fields and disciplines.
* The [D vocabulary](#d-vocabulary) with words for aesthetic areas such as music, art, dance and literature.

## A vocabulary

Everyday words and phrases. In Newspeak, adjectives were formed by adding the suffix -ful to the noun verb, and adverbs by adding -wise. Thus, for example, speedful meant "rapid" and speedwise meant "quickly". In Bleedingedgespeak pseudo-verbs are formed by adding -ing to a verb. For example, "actioning", "leveraging" and "onboarding".

| Word(s) | What it means |
| --- | :-- |
|Actioning [pv] |Habitual or vigorous activity for achieving business goals. //Don't bother me while I'm actioning my deliverables.// |
|Empowering (someone) [pv] | To grant someone the authority to do something. //You can do a little bit of this, but I’m still in charge here, I am empowering you.// | 
|Leveraging  [pv]|Manipulating or controlling a situation or environment. //We are leveraging our assets.//  |
|Onboarding [pv]|Adding a new resource to a project or work team and completing all internal bureaucracy that entails. //As part of our onboarding process we will add you to our identity management system. This requires you to fill in a form with questions for example on what social media you are on, a retina scan and taking your fingerprints. Not a problem, is it? // |


## B vocabulary 

Words, phrases and expressions with political or ideological significance, specially tailored to engender blind acceptance of IT doctrines (and includes (neo)liberal and military speak).

| Word(s) | What it means |
| --- | :-- |
|Aces in their places [exp] |Matching skills with opportunity, knowing the value of their people, the vision of the company, and endeavors to bring out the best in both. //Aces in their places! Everybody to their cubicles for leveraging our core competencies!// |
|Best practice [exp.] |The accepted term used to require people to gather together in boiling ocean (time wasting) meets (meetings) in which a (most likely a consultants') robust solution is explained, a solution so revolutionary or so unique that all are required to adopt it. The term is applied broadly and across industries and is used in connection with everything from project management to audit functions. //The agenda for tomorrow's meeting is to share best practices.// |
|Buy-in [exp] |I did not value you enough to involve you in the decision making, but now I want you to embrace it as if I had. //Buying in can be similar to selling out. The difference is semantics and often also keeping ones job or not.// |
|Core competency [n] |A company's or person's distinguishing advantage. Leveraged of course. //With the technocrats, he believed in an enlightened absolutism, and looked to the CEO to carry through all proposals from the shareholders. As to the employees, he opposed all interference on their part in decision making, considering that they had no core competency outside the sphere of their cubicles.// |
|Bleeding edge [n] |Something even more current than the "cutting-edge". Reserved for revolutionary bladed weapons or new and much hyped technology that has either not yet been fully tested to see whether it works correctly, or doesn't (yet) have any practical application. //My new smartphone is bleeding edge. Hopefully with the next update it gets useful. I really need to cut the meet (short). // |
|Impact [n] |The force transmitted during a collision. //Don't worry, performance as senior manager or executive has very little impact upon bonus.//  |
|Issue [n] |Euphemism for problem. //Houston, we have an issue!//  |
|It is what it is  [exp]|A phrase that seems to state the obvious, but can indicate an acceptance of complexity and ambiguity, or indicate an acceptance of limitations, or may well have other shades of meaning, or be evolving new shades of meaning. //It is what it is.//  | 
|Forefront [n]|The position of most importance, prominence, or responsibility; the vanguard, the technocrats. //The most significant contribution of the forefront is their emphasis on productive work (by others) and information (of others) as the main source of wealth, which can then be appropriated and sold.// | 
|Over the wall [exp] |Free after having escaped from prison; Sending something from the office to someone outside the office; Also a West Belfast phrase for amazing, brilliant, fantastic etc. //He/she/the record/the dataset/the document/the files/the entire database is over the wall!//  |
|On (someone's) radar [exp] |Within the spectrum of (someone's) awareness, attention, or consideration. //If you want this issue on people's radar, you have to frame it as something that will impact their wallets.//  |
|Outside the box [exp] |A creative solution that avoids a traditional or common approach. The box concept has lost all meaning with everyone claiming to be thinking outside of it, unless the abilities of an AI product immediately after purchase without any upgrades or integration is meant. //We are pleased the new robust AI solution worked right out of the box, but it doesn't seem to solve the issues we bought it for. Ah well, it is what it is. //|
|Paradigm shift  [exp.] |A transition between old and new beliefs, sounding important, dramatic, and revolutionary. It is used as descriptor for pretty much any kind of change by a person who likes to use bleedingedgespeak.  //Now that I am the manager, we are going to experience some paradigm shifts around here.//  |

|Sharing (opening kimonos)|Giving something that belongs to you to someone else, for some reason, which could be but is not necessarily out of the goodness of your heart. //If you’re sharing secrets or proprietary information, just share them and be done with it. There is no advantage in bringing hidden body parts into the discussion.//| 
|Solution [n] |A collection of technologies or over-priced consulting services too abstract, complex or esoteric to describe in a way that anyone would care about if they were explained in plain language. An e-solution is something to do with the Internet. No-one is really sure what it does. //We offer robust solutions for our customers.//  | 
|Submission [v] |An act of submitting (information) to the authority or control of another. //I am going to submit information on the internet anywhere anyway.// |
|Taking it to the next level [exp] |Means nothing because nobody knows what the next level looks like or even if there is one.

## C vocabulary

Words that relate specifically to science and to technical fields and disciplines. It is designed to ensure that technical knowledge remains segmented among many fields, so that no one individual can gain access to too much knowledge.

| Word(s) | What it means |
| --- | :-- | 
|Algorithm |Mathematical formulas or statistical processes used in a precise process for solving a specific issue in a finite number of steps. A term programmers use when they don't want to explain their code. //I optimized the running time of the algorithm. // |
|Analytics |This term has not been properly defined by the professional community and may mean different things to different people. For example, it may mean the process of drawing conclusions based on raw information, or it may mean how an entity arrives at the most optimal or realistic decision from a variety of available options, based on existing data (or some heuristics). Through analysis, otherwise meaningless data and numbers can be transformed into something possibly useful some day. In data-mining, the focus is on inference, thereby turning the "something possibly useful" into something fictional. Perhaps that is why data analysts are often well-versed in the art of story-telling. //Common applications of analytics include the study of data using statistical analysis in order to discover and understand historical patterns with an eye to predicting and improving some thing in the future.// |
|Cloud computing|To put or store (resources, software, and information) into a computing infrastructure over a network (typically the internet) instead of a hard drive. //If you consider the internet as being similar to a "cloud", in the way that it seemingly floats ubiquitously over everything on Earth and is not owned by anyone (except for the physical infrastructure way at the bottom somewhere, and those peeps own our asses since we have made our entire economy dependent on the internet), then cloud computing is using a cheap, rudimentary computer terminal as the only hardware you need in order to accomplish fully functional computing. // |
|Daas, IaaS, PaaS, SaaS |Data as a service, infrastructure as a service, platform as a service, software as a service, all solutions in the cloud that were popular in 2015. //While at home I daased my datasets and auxiliary information in the cloud so that I could later access them at the library.//|
|Data mining |Exploring large sets of data to find patterns and insight by means of highly analytical processes that emphasise making use of large datasets and probably involve the use of some artificial intelligence, machine learning or statistics. A kind of research which studies existing research, with the motive of repurposing it to promote a certain interpretation. A common means of developing spin for a story. //Using data mining, I was able to make the last several wars look like clear victories for all involved.// |
|Dark data |Information gathered and processed, but never put to real use. Instead, it is sitting in the dark, waiting ... //The crucial point to understand about dark data is that it doesn’t have to remain dark. // |
|Database | An organized collection of data that may include charts, schemas or tables. It may also be integrated into a Database Management System (DBMS), a software that allows data to be explored and analysed. The term "database" was thrown around so much it was eventually used as a derogatory term for know-it-alls. //"So, what do you think of the manager?", "A real database.", "Yes, I suppose he does store a lot of information."//|
|Hadoop |An Apache open source software framework for storing files and processing data, making it easy to run a multitude of tasks concurrently. //FAILED: Execution Error, return code 1 from org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.exec.DDLTask. Cannot validate serde: org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.OpenCSVSerde. You will have to use the serde jar that is compatible with the distribution. //|
|IoT | An acronym for "Internet of Things", wherein everyday objects (such as phones, wearables, cars, refrigerators and light bulbs) embedded with network connectivity, can talk to each other and can be accessed and possibly controlled via the Internet. //The massive DDOS attack took advantage of a botnet built out of IoT devices.// |
|IoE  |An acronym for "Internet of Everything", combining products, people and processes to generate even more connectivity. //Physical and cyber security solutions must work intelligently together and protect the networks, devices, applications, users, and data that make up the IoE. Seriously? // |
|Machine learning |An Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithm that proposes solutions to an issue after learning from several trial and error attempts. Though machine learning is not new, it is gaining massive traction as a modern data analysis tool. //The use of statistical inference, machine learning and visualisation techniques on security data has become a key component of our robust security solutions for the IoT and IoE. //|
|MapReduce | The now freely available programming model for processing and generating large data sets that gave Google infinite ability to acquire and manipulate data. It describes a way to distribute the power of a master node over an infinite number of worker nodes. //The "Map" turns one dataset into another, more useful and broken down dataset made of bits called tuples. The "Reduce" takes all of the broken down tuples and breaks them down even further. The result is a practical breakdown of information.// |
|Neural network |A neural network simulates the brain via computer algorithms to generate artificial intelligence. //Deep Learning is a similar term, and is generally seen as bleedingedgespeak for shifting the neural network paradigm to make it sound more mysterious and interesting for people today. //|
|R | A programming language that works with statistical computing and is considered one of the more important and most popular languages in data science. //In 2011, Yihui Xie released a package named "fun" in R, a collection of some classical computer games, but he did not dare to send an announcement as usual. // |
|Spark |An open-source computing framework originally developed at University of California, Berkely, and later donated to Apache Software. Spark is mostly used for machine learning and interactive analytics. //Spark is another data brick in the wall. // |


## D vocabulary

Words for aesthetic areas such as music, art, dance and literature. It is designed to ensure that the capacity for eliciting the metaphorical power of its incarnate qualities remains limited, and also includes typical technical terms and framing from the C vocabulary to make sure artists(-to-be) are more impressed with and more easily controllable by critical words of system representatives (which are certified and in a "position of power" of course).

| Word(s) | What it means |
| --- | :-- |  
|Avant-garde | Literally means "advance guard" or "vanguard" and is used to refer to people or works that are experimental or innovative. Supposedly it represents a pushing of the boundaries of what is accepted as the norm or the status quo and is considered by some to be a hallmark of modernism. //Your work is so avant-garde, it speaks to so many aspects at once, it is way beyond its time//, or better yet, // Avant-garde is French for bullshit//. |
|Brain |Big wad in head that controls all functions and gives the ability to remember stuff. //Simple melodies that seep into your brain//. |
|Classic |An over used word used by to describe just about everything. //... an instant/soon-to-be classic //|
|Cleverly-written |Mentally bright; having sharp or quick intelligence; able. //The piece of music was cleverly-written to please the left-hemisphere's liking for  easily predictable rhythm. // |
|Codifying |To make a digest of; arrange in a systematic collection. //With regard to the issue of content, the reductive quality of the figurative-narrative line-space matrix verges on codifying the remarkable handling of light in this painting.//  |
|Contemporary art |Art that most people think is either confusing or crap. // ... it is in the nature of original contemporary art to present itself as a bad risk. And we the public, artists included, should be proud of being in this predicament, because nothing else would seem to us quite true to life; and art, after all, is supposed to be a mirror of life.” ― Leo Steinberg, Other Criteria: Confrontations with Twentieth-Century Art //|
|Juxtaposition  |Contrasts and differences shown side by side or together. //As an advocate of the Aesthetic, I feel that the mechanical mark-making of the gesture visually and conceptually activates the distinctive formal juxtapositions.// |
