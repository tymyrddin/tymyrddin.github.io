How much you earn can determine your lifestyle, where you can afford to live, and your aspirations and status. But to what extent does what we get paid confer ​‘worth’? We now live in a society of extremes. The incomes of the very rich and the very poor continue to pull away from each other. What, exactly, is meant by “inequality”? What is inequality doing to us? Why should we care about it? Why is nothing done about it? 

Equality, according to economist [Amartya Sen](https://scholar.harvard.edu/sen/home), is “equality of capability to function fully as a human being. Such a capability clearly entails survival, health (and aids for disability), freedom and knowledge (education) to choose one’s life-path, and resources to pursue it.”

Inequalities then, are _“multidimensional barriers to human functioning in the world”_ and violations of the declaration of human rights.

## Declaration of human rights

### Article 25

* Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social services, and the right to security in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age or other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control.
* Motherhood and childhood are entitled to special care and assistance. All children, whether born in or out of wedlock, shall enjoy the same social protection.

### Article 26

* Everyone has the right to education. Education shall be free, at least in the elementary and fundamental stages. Elementary education shall be compulsory. Technical and professional education shall be made generally available and higher education shall be equally accessible to all on the basis of merit.
* Education shall be directed to the full development of the human personality and to the strengthening of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. It shall promote understanding, tolerance and friendship among all nations, racial or religious groups, and shall further the activities of the United Nations for the maintenance of peace.
* Parents have a prior right to choose the kind of education that shall be given to their children.

## Results so far

It seems we haven't gotten very far implementing that yet. 

### Types of inequality

* Health inequality, which can be measured relatively easily through life-expectancy and survival rates, destroys millions of human lives in the world every year.
* Existential inequality restricts the freedom of action of certain categories of persons, for example that of marginalised groups in public spaces. It means denial of (equal) recognition and respect, and is a generator of humiliations - for women in patriarchal societies, for indigenous groups, for immigrants, for those of low caste, for refugees, and for stigmatised ethnic groups. Existential inequality can be overt and brutal (genocide) but also covert and subtle (suggestions on having lower worth embedded in culture), and comes at a cost for all of us.
* Resource inequality (alias inequality of opportunity) means human actors have different resources to draw upon, for example access to social capital (education, social contacts, job options, etc) and inequality of rewards (inequality of outcome), meaning the distribution of income and wealth. It blocks change.

### Ruling class

What then does the ruling class do when it rules? From the monarchies of mediaeval Europe through the bourgeois democracies of the west in the 20th century to the contemporary regimes in Russia, Eastern Europe and China, it ensures that its dominant positions in the economy, state apparatus and ideological superstructures are reproduced by the state in rela­tion both to the other modes of production present within the social formation and to the international system of social formations. These reproductive state interventions are enmeshed in the struc­tural dynamics of the mode of reproduction, but they also have to be secured in the thick of the class struggle. In short, inequality keeps them in power. 

### Worth? Value? Costs?

That depends on the context and what is meant by “worth”.

As a member of a church it would be something like “perceived goodness, understanding of scripture, speaking and musical ability, cooking, nurturing, willingness to contribute either capital or labour to projects deemed worthwhile, and overall friendliness”. In a gang it would be something like “a gregarious nature, unwilling to be controlled (by other than gang members), and enjoying music that reflect these values, and adhering to an (usually) unspoken code of dress and action”.

Larger Western society seems to operate on the basis of a person's “lifestyle” worthy of emulating. Things like money, notoriety, and power seem to be universally desired, but are not always valued by our closest friends and relatives.

To what extent does what we get paid confer ​‘worth’? The [New Economics Foundation (NEF)](https://neweconomics.org/2009/12/a-bit-rich/) went beyond how much different professions are paid to look at what they actually contribute to society, using some of the principles and valuation techniques of Social Return on Investment analysis to quantify the social, environmental and economic value that these roles produce – or in some cases undermine.

* Early theories of value neglected the extent to which the production and trade of goods and services may have a wider impact on the world that is not reflected in the cost of producing them. These ​‘externalities’ are often remote or hard to see but that does not mean that they are not real or that they do not affect real beings – either now or in the future.
* Because social and environmental costs are not properly accounted for, the market tends to oversupply products that may have a significantly negative environmental or social impact – such as cheap consumer goods and complex financial products. In the same way we underpay work that has a high social value, creating high vacancy rates in our most important public services such as nursing and social work. By making social value creation an important societal goal we could set the right incentives to maximise net social benefits, ensure a greater return to labour rather than capital, and a more equal distribution of economic resources between workers.

[Economic Inequality Kills](https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/how-economic-inequality-kills/) and the caravan of financial capitalist inequality is moving on, at an unhampered  speed.  And  all  other  issues  of  inequality  remain,  not  only  in  existence but beyond conventional imagination ([Therborn](http://www.scielo.mec.pt/pdf/aso/n212/n212a08.pdf)

## Getting out

_The battle is about to start. Nobody knows how it will end. Which side will you be on?_ ~ Gran Therborn

Making the best of our culturally conditioned habits of self-valuation isn’t easy. It invites the rejection of the contingent-worth logic of self-esteem entrenched in Western society (“I’m only as good as my last achievement or success” or “a good deed is a good me and a bad deed is a bad me”) in favour of self-acceptance, and that is hard work which requires practice, practice, practice.
