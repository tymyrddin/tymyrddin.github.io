A [Visualisation of Decision Architecture: "Helping" Users Make Better Decisions](https://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2010/11/decision-architecture-helping-users-make-better-decisions.php) as used in marketing and sales practices in the [Century of the Self]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/cause-and-effect/century-of-the-self):

* Gut processing is sophisticated, intuitive, and quick. Gut enables an efficient way of navigating a complex world.
* Head processing, on the other hand, is analytical, slow, and rational.
* According to Gardner, “Gut decides, Head reviews: This process is how most of our thoughts and decisions are made.” Essentially, we are of two minds, each of which works semi-independently of the other.
* Gut processing always precedes Head processing. The “||” in the connector means a delay.
* Even if Head steps in and overrules Gut, this does not negate the impact of Gut on a decision. It is our initial impressions, our initial reactions to things, that shape and color the thoughts and judgments that follow.
* Sometimes, Head doesn’t bother to monitor Gut. Sometimes, Head doesn’t step in at all. When this happens, decision making occurs automatically, under the radar of our conscious attention.
* Gut can sometimes apply mental shortcuts that really aren’t appropriate to the situation at hand or are simply incorrect.
* Head can’t look inside Gut to figure out how or why Gut operates the way it does. Our subconscious is much like a black box with no access doors. It’s strictly off limits to the conscious mind. All Head can do is monitor and override Gut; it can’t change or negate the influence of Gut.
* One reason Head may fail to actively take part in the process of decision making is because conscious thought takes effort. People are remarkably sensitive to the effort of conscious decision making—the mental processing that occurs primarily within the pre-frontal cortex.
* In a 1999 experiment, Shiv and Fedorikhin tested the effect of cognitive load on decision making: Distracting Head with a memory task made people more susceptible to temptation.
* A person’s objective in decision making is to arrive at the best possible decision outcome with the least possible effort. Better decision outcomes typically require more effort. So, decision makers must make trade-offs between the two, adjusting their strategy according to the importance of the decision they’re making.
