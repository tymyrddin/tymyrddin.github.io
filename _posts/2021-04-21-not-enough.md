The [GDPR]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/elephants/gdpr) is not enough, and that is not only because of the tremendous struggle to implement its rules. It actually legitimises the entire information industry by making it a grey area. 

_Politics no longer seems to be able to cope with six of the greatest challenges of our time: destruction of the environment, digitalisation, the power of algorithms, systematic lies in politics, unchecked globalisation and threats to the rule of law. We all want to live in an environment that is healthy and protected. We want to use the internet in a way determined by us, without being scrutinised and manipulated, we want to be able to trust intelligent machines and not be threatened by them. We have seen that the prerequisite of our democracy is truth and not lies, and we want to end the exploitation of people in a globalised world. The old constitutions of Europe have no clear answers for the enormous upheavals of recent years._

## We Demand Six New Fundamental Rights

A constitutional convention should expand the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union to include the following fundamental rights:

### Article 1 - Environment

Everyone has the right to live in an environment that is healthy and protected.

### Article 2 - Digital self-determination

Everyone has the right to digital self-determination. Excessive profiling or the manipulation of people is forbidden.

### Article 3 - Artiﬁcial intelligence

Everyone has the right to know that any algorithms imposed on them are transparent, verifiable and fair. Major decisions must be taken by a human being.

### Article 4 - Truth

Everyone has the right to trust that statements made by the holders of public ofﬁce are true.

### Article 5 - Globalization

Everyone has the right to be offered only those goods and services that are produced and provided in accordance with universal human rights.

### Article 6 - Fundamental rights lawsuits

Everyone has the right to bring a lawsuit before the European Courts when the Charter’s fundamental rights are systematically violated.
