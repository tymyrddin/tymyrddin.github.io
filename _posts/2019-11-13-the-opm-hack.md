From the You-have-seriously-got-to-be-kidding-me Dept.

The hack of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) probably started in 2012, was discovered in 2014 and did not become public until mid-2015. It took another 15 months for Congress to complete a report on it. This story is most interesting in all of its detail:

* Hackers, most likely from China, were inside the OPM system starting in 2012.
* March 20, 2014 the hack was discovered.
* In May 2014, a second (group of) hacker(s) gained access through a third-party contractor, but was not discovered until mid-2015.
* Much of what is contained in the report had already been covered in the IT or mainstream press.
    * There had been early warnings about how vulnerable the department was.
    * There was no IT security staff until 2013, no encryption or two-factor authentication for workers remotely accessing the system, no inventory of servers and databases and a general lack of awareness of all the systems connected to its networks.
    * The report summarized that the breach, and the failure to detect and contain it were, “in large part due to sloppy cyber hygiene and inadequate security technologies that left OPM with reduced visibility into the traffic on its systems.”
    * Tell-tale key findings: “OPM failed to heed repeated recommendations from its Inspector General,” starting in 2005. The discovery of the hack in March 2014 “should have sounded a high level, multi-agency national security alarm that a sophisticated, persistent actor was seeking to access OPM’s highest-value data.”
* A June 2015 letter from then OPM CIO Donna K. Seymour to the millions of victims of the breach reads that the Office of Personnel Management: “takes very seriously its responsibility to protect your information,” and offered credit monitoring service and identity fraud insurance as “a courtesy,” followed by ”Nothing in this letter should be construed as OPM or the US Government accepting liability for any of the matters covered by this letter or for any other purpose.“
* Neither Donna Seymour nor Kathleen Archuleta (head of the OPM at the time) were fired. As a nasty detail, Seymour was retired two days before she was scheduled to appear before Congress to talk about the breach.

The story shows human vulnerabilities in deep state, and left those who had a record in the stolen data flabbergasted and devastated with concern for family members. A colleague wrote:

_“My SF-86 lists every place I’ve ever lived since I was 18, every foreign travel I’ve ever taken, all of my family, their addresses,” he said. “So it’s not just my identity that’s affected. I’ve got siblings. I’ve got five kids. All of that is in there.”_
