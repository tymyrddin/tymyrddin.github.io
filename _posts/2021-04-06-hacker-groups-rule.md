These are some ingredients for one of five possible example [scenario narratives]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/scenario-planning):

## Plot
* Autonomous collectives, cartel-paid mercenary and nation-state-sponsored hacker groups grow, expand and escalate.
* Cartels that have the resources to respond with “security measures” also grow, expand, and escalate.
* Some cartels establish “safe havens” (fiefdoms) and will start charging (a lot) for membership or require more private data from its “members” to “cover the costs”.

## Likely effects

* Increase in attacks.
* Security costs escalate.
* Aggressive corporate and national cyberespionage.
* Defensive cartels get to set their pricing.
* Supply chain for attackers as well as defenders grows.
* Organisations and cartels build their own counter-attack teams.
* Within cartels, attack and defensive information is shared, and counter-attack teams collaborate.

## Measurables and observables

* Attack patterns: more malware infections and advanced persistent threats.
* Forming of cartels like the Cyber Threat Alliance and Cloud Security Alliance.
* Increased "military speak" in white hat contexts like "Critical Security Controls" and "Certified Ethical Hacker" (EC-Council funded). Security and privacy campaigning NGO's internally talk about their clients as “target audience”.
* More tools created and gathered in Kali Linux by Offensive Security.
