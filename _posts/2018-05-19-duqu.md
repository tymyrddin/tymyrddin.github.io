In 2011, the CrySyS Lab of the Budapest University of Technology and Economics in Hungary discovered the Duqu worm. It seems to be related to Stuxnet, but was designed to gather industrial information rather than to interfere with industrial operations. It is possibly the creation of Unit 8200.

Experts compared the similarities with Stuxnet and found three points of interest:

* The installer exploits zero-day Windows kernel vulnerabilities.
* Components are signed with stolen digital keys.
* Duqu and Stuxnet are both highly targeted and related to the nuclear program of Iran.

On June 2015 [Duqu 2.0](https://securelist.com/the-mystery-of-duqu-2-0-a-sophisticated-cyberespionage-actor-returns/70504/) appeared at Kaspersky Lab. Duqu 2.0, alleged to be the most sophisticated computer virus ever developed, compromised Kaspersky Lab in 2014. Duqu 2.0 used at least three zero-day exploits. The virus remained for months on Kaspersky Lab's systems, undetected by them. Aside from targeting Kaspersky, it was used to spy on the negotiations for the Iran Nuclear Deal.
