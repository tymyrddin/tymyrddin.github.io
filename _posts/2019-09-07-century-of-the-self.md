The [Century of the Self (playlist on youtube)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLktPdpPFKHfoXRfTPOwyR8SG8EHLWOSj6) is a 2002 British television documentary series by filmmaker Adam Curtis. In episode one, Curtis says, _“This series is about how those in power have used Freud's theories to try and control the dangerous crowd in an age of mass democracy.”_
 
* Happiness machines covers the genesis of psychoanalysis in the early twentieth century and asserts that the theory and its interpretation by American public relation agencies stood at the base of the modern consumer society and political theory. Edward Bernays is identified as being essential in this as he was the first to commercially exploit the theory by arguing that if companies could link their products to people's emotional desires and feelings they would be more likely to buy them.
* The engineering of consent: The initially benevolent intentions of psychoanalysts to strengthen core democratic values changed for the worse when they were implemented for commercial and political exploitation. The elite considered it necessary to create conditions which would produce individuals who would behave as good consumers and conform to democratic society. Conversely, contemporary social critics argued that inner-emotional drives were not inherently violent or evil; it was society that made them dangerous through repression and distortion.
* There is a Policeman Inside All Our Heads; He Must Be Destroyed explains how the values of social transformation of the self-help movements in the 1960s were eventually encapsulated in commercial exploitation and political manipulation. The generation who had once rebelled against the conformity imposed by consumerism and politics, now embraced it because it helped them to be themselves.
* Eight People Sipping Wine in Kettering: The politicians who were using techniques from psychoanalysis believed they were creating a new and better form of democracy, one that truly responded to the inner feelings of the individual. But what they did not realize was that the aim of those who had originally created these techniques had not been to liberate the people but to develop a new way of controlling them in an age of mass democracy.
