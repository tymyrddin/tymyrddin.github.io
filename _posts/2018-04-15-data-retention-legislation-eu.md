In two judgments, the [Digital Rights Ireland case (2014)](https://www.eff.org/node/81899) and the [Tele-2/Watson decision (2016)](https://www.fieldfisher.com/en/services/privacy-security-and-information/privacy-security-and-information-law-blog/the-tele2watson-case-what-are-the-key-takeaways-and-what-is-to-become-of-the-new-investigatory-powers-act), the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) reaffirmed the requirement that all data retention regimes must comply with the principles of legality, necessity, and proportionality.

The [Data retention legislation in Europe](https://observatory.mappingtheinternet.eu/page/data-retention-legislation-europe) page lists how the national members states have reacted to the 2014 decision and if there is a constitutional complaint on the national data retention laws. The basic [standard laid down by the CJEU](https://www.statewatch.org/media/documents/news/2017/nov/eu-eurojust-data-retention-MS-report-10098-17.pdf) is not adhered to by most EU member states, despite their legal obligation to comply with the Courtâ€™s jurisprudence.
