The elements of fire, water and air have formed the earth for billions of years - until humans changed the planet dramatically in a very short time.

A documentary by Dirk Steffens, Leart Dokle, and Georgi Gotsin, production of ZDF Terra X.

From around 10,000 BC, people began to work on the landscape available to them, no longer content with what nature gives. They dig around in the soil, they plant, they understand what makes a soil more fertile. They divert water and dig wells to bring it up from the depths. And they use the power of fire to make their lives more comfortable. All this changed the three elements in a very short period of time and set in motion a process that changed the face of the world once and for all.

Today, satellite images give us a literally global view of the consequences of human activity: agricultural land covers large parts of the earth's surface with geometric patterns, mega-cities sprawl over seemingly endless areas, roads wind their way even through high mountains and deserts. The so-called "technosphere," the things produced by humans, now weighs more than all animals and plants together. Roughly 50 kilograms of human work weigh on every square meter of the planet. And the world's population is growing and growing. 

Scientists today speak of the Anthropocene, the age of humans. This video looks at Earth. Presenter Dirk Steffens takes the audience on a journey through a history of mankind. Rise and fall of empires, migrations or inventions - all of them are examined for their effects on the state of the nature of the earth.

With surprising findings, the most serious of which is this: times of crisis in human civilization, such as ongoing phases of war or declines in population growth, were always times when nature recovered. But the conclusion that human progress and the environment simply do not go together could be drawn too soon.
