No doubt Yuval Noah Harari is a good writer. I read his books and was impressed by how he explains the importance of empires and that the agricultural and industrial revolutions were, at best, mixed blessings. And in this interview he discusses the myths of money and patriarchy, two of the elephants in the room. 

_"Humans suffer, animals suffer, but nations do not suffer"_

Yet I also have some critiques on his works. In his books (and interviews), he also regularly gives plausible, yet to my knowledge incorrect (or debated) explanations of the major events in human history and their impacts on the world. And it is always important to investigate further and prove my own thinking wrong. New books on my list:

Science and history (supposedly more grounded):
* The Red Queen: Sex and the Evolution of Human Nature, Matt Ridley 
* The Origin of Virtue, Matt Ridley
* Nature via Nurture: Genes, Experience and What Makes Us Human, Matt Ridley 
Development of virtue, cooperation, and less physical violence:
* The Moral Animal: Why We Are, the Way We Are: The New Science of Evolutionary Psychology, Robert Wright
* The Evolution of God, Robert Wright
On the doctrine of natural law:
* Hardwired Behavior: What Neuroscience Reveals about Morality, Laurence Tancredi
On evolutionary biology
* Alas Poor Darwin: Arguments Against Evolutionary Psychology, Hilary Rose and Steven Rose
