The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) is an intergovernmental economic organisation with 35 member countries, founded in 1961 to stimulate economic progress and world trade. It is a forum of countries describing themselves as committed to democracy and the market economy, providing a platform to compare policy experiences, seeking answers to common problems, identify good practices and coordinate domestic and international policies of its members.

It's recommendations for protection of personal data are:

* Notice — data subjects should be given notice when their data is being collected;
* Purpose — data should only be used for the purpose stated and not for any other purposes;
* Consent — data should not be disclosed without the data subject’s consent;
* Security — collected data should be kept secure from any potential abuses;
* Disclosure — data subjects should be informed as to who is collecting their data;
* Access — data subjects should be allowed to access their data and make corrections to any inaccurate data
* Accountability — data subjects should have a method available to them to hold data collectors accountable for not following the above principles.

The [EC General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/elephants/gdpr) has incorporated all seven principles. The United States, while endorsing the recommendations, is not implementing them.
