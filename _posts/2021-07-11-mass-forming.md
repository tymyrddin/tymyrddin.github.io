COVID comes with effects, COVID lockdowns come with effects, COVID containment measures by governments come with effects ... and some related very complex issues.

[Mathias Desmet](https://dissident.one/2021/01/21/mattias-desmet-professor-klinische-psychologie-coronamaatregelen-onthullen-totalitaire-trekken/), a clinical psychologist from the Netherlands has posed that decades of propaganda, and politicised (weaponised) science (modern man's object of worship), along with calming pretty nature documentaries has caused a slumbering but large amount of stress and fear and an experienced lack of meaning in society, paving the way for "mass-forming": a crowd (or nation or...) becomes susceptible to a single story (with subsequent roads of behaviours and solutions) to be appointed as the object of fear), causing people to follow measures that go against their own wellbeing while they become remarkably indifferent to reason, information or other views on the story, and also to human suffering outside the tiny focus of the story.

I am taking the time to investigate in order to refute "mass forming" actually happening.

## The rabbit hole of the screens

Lockdowns measures have had many effects, and the two that stand out for me that have not been in our best interest in this context are:

* The increasingly pervasive diffusion of digital technologies causes (among other things) missing elements of physical presence in one-on-one and group discussions by which people experience loss of some experience of the senses, which in turn causes loss of some social dimensions from being an identity, from life, and thereby causing mental health problems. 
* With everybody behind screens and/or in lockdown, the streets are increasingly empty, speeding up the continued economic crash of smaller physical retailers while increasing economic boost of large online retailers.

Neither of these two examples is new. Covid and the measures taken has merely exacerbated these issues that make more vulnerable to a single story while becoming remarkably indifferent to reason, information or other views on stories, and also to human suffering outside the tiny focus of our own story.

## Media

By its nature, the spread of COVID-19 is a cause of public anxiety and is not of itself the product of media reporting, and journalists covering the coronavirus story are caught between two ethical obligations: the obligation to truth-telling and the obligation not to add unjustifiably to public anxiety that can cause [shock effects](https://naomiklein.org/the-shock-doctrine/).

To choose what to publish in such difficult times, journalists often use a triage system:

* Stories containing health advice, information about the spread of the illness, who is at risk, what governments and other authorities are doing in response, what is happening to the economy, and how ordinary life is being disrupted.
* Considered less important, but more entertaining, are stories on fights over toilet paper, fencing being the perfect sport, masks, gloves and stabbing everyone that comes near enough.
* Stories that are considered rubbish such as conspiracy theories.

As a result of that, personal bias regarding what is a "conspiracy theory" plays a big role in the decision making in the media. Or, its source is considered to determine whether it falls in the third category, which could lead to authority fallacies, and to name calling wars.

### Category 1 news

By the way, here is some category one news: _Most countries have Acts or Laws relating to "biosecurity" under which people with listed diseases may be subject to “human biosecurity control orders”. Control orders can require people, among other things, to provide their contact information and health details (including body samples for diagnosis), restrict their behaviour, undergo risk-minimisation interventions (including decontamination) and/or medical treatment, accept isolation from the community for specified periods._

### Category 2 news

And here is some category two news: _"[Pandemics]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/cause-and-effect/likelihood-of-pandemics.md) as a result of neo-liberal globalisation, and terrorist attacks as a result of militaristic or secret service interventions for plundering other nations (sorry, "for economically stabilising countries that have oil, minerals or other resources"), and all of the subsequent measures to protect us from what comes back to us are "the price of freedom", but having to wear a mask for 10 minutes in a shop is "tyranny"?"_ Gives to think, doesn't it?

### Category 3 news

And some category three not-so-news: _An admission of uncertainty isn't a condemnation of science or a validation of a conspiracy theory. It is how science works. Science can prove a theory wrong, but it can never prove it right because there are ambiguities, the emergence of new evidence and in the case of "mass forming" theory, the shifting of individual and collective perspectives._

## Lack of transparency

_"Up until the third of july some 17300 vaccine-related deaths (in EU-countries) were reported at EudraVigilance from the EMA (european medicines agency), together with 1,7 million adverse reactions to the vaccines, half of which severe (strokes, heart-inflammation etc). On EudraVigilance these numbers are split up in numerous side-effect-per-brandname, In this way you have to do a lot of counting to get the total number. There is underreporting and estimates are that this number represents between 1 to 10% of the actual number of cases, which is still rising."_

When I tried verifying this data I came to the [EudraVigilance European database of suspected adverse drug reaction reports](https://www.adrreports.eu/en), where I read: 

<span style="color:red">NEW!</span> To consult the reports for COVID-19 vaccines, follow this [link](https://www.adrreports.eu/en/disclaimer.html), then click on the letter 'C' and scroll down until "COVID-19".

And when I did that I first got to read and accept a disclaimer, after which a list came up, which did not contain the item "COVID-19" under "C" (or anywhere else).

So then I tried the blue COVID-19 message button on the frontpage. It took me to a page [COVID-19 important messages](https://www.adrreports.eu/en/covid19_message.html) where under the heading "Warning for cases with a fatal outcome" I found a link to the [European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu) where I also found no report that can verify the statement above.

I did find a message:

*Due to technical issues with TESSy data processing, several of ECDC’s routine surveillance outputs on COVID-19 are delayed or may contain incomplete data. ECDC is working to resolve this issue as quickly as possible and will post the updated data and outputs as soon as they become available.*

I'll keep trying. Hopefully this report will be available somewhere soon. And then not only verify that number, but also look at where the data came from, and how it was gathered.

## Visibility of alternative strategies

If I were to find messages and articles on other scientific views and alternative strategies on official websites like the one I just found above, the [European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu), then the "Mass forming" narrative stands on swampy ground.

Two, reasonably known (at least in my circles), are on red algae nasal spray and on vitamine D.

* Vitamin D is not only a vitamin, but also a hormone which supports the immune system. Several studies concluded Vitamin D deficiency is significantly associated with increased risk for COVID-19, but a new New Cornell-led research found little to no evidence of a link between a person’s normal blood levels of vitamin D and risk of getting COVID-19, or the severity of an infection. Still, have any of these studies been mentioned?
* Carrageenans or carrageenins are a family of natural linear sulfated polysaccharides that are extracted from red edible seaweeds. In a nasal spray, this [could be a safe and effective treatment that could prevent transmission of COVID-19](https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04521322). Maybe these are mentioned?

I have not been able to refute the Mass forming theory (yet). Stay tuned for updates on ambiguities, the emergence of new evidence and the shifting of individual and collective perspectives. Probably no need to hold on to your hats though.
