From the Emmenthaler-cheese-with-extra-holes Dept.

In May of 2014, eBay announced a massive data breach of sensitive data. The breach posed severe risks for general identity theft and password theft. It compromised names, addresses, dates of birth and encrypted passwords of all of its 145 million users. Consumers were advised to change passwords and use credit monitoring services.

Apparently, hackers got into the company network using the credentials of three corporate employees, were in the system for 229 days, and were able to make their way to the user database. eBay did not give details on how the hackers got the credentials in the first place, but as is the case with most attacks that result in credential theft, the attackers probably used a social-engineering attack of some kind, most likely phishing.

As a side note, a few days later, eBay-owned PayPal posted a blog entitled _“eBay, Inc. to Ask All eBay users to Change Passwords.”_ The blog post included nothing but the title, but quickly hit the Web after it was retweeted dozens of times. The blog post was then taken down from PayPal's site, causing even more confusion. Word had it PayPal, owned by eBay, was also hacked.

In 2016, an Independent Security Researcher [reported a critical vulnerability to eBay](https://ret2libc.wordpress.com/2016/01/11/a-tale-of-ebay-xss-and-shoddy-incident-response/) that had the capability to allow hackers to host a fake login page, a phishing page, on the eBay website in an effort to steal users' password and harvest credentials from millions of its users.
