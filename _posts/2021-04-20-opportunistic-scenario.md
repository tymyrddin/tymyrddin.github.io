Globalisation of [ravenous runs of commodification]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/cause-and-effect/ravenous-runs) seems to cause a multitude of interconnected fatal consequences: a large destruction of the natural world and erosion of established cultures, social disintegration, a breakdown of democracy, more rapid and extensive deterioration of the environment, the spread of new diseases, and increasing poverty and alienation. And our road to it was most likely quite opportunistically developed and then due to success, repeated. 

Suppose an "ally" with commodified resources:

* Evasion of real civilian control is made possible by military-to-military and political-to-political relations. Building military-to-military relations with an unreformed and un-reforming military undermines efforts by citizens to rein in such institutions.
* Economic ties between first and second and third world countries relies too heavily on cheap labour, with inadequate attention given to the rights of workers performing such labour.
* Investments are too often focused on extractive industries exploiting local natural resources. While profitable to first world investors and their elite local second and third world partners, these investments too often devastate environments with ruinous implications. Let’s name this for what it is: engaging in environmentally criminal behaviour. Forests are destroyed for timber or establishing plantations, with no thought to the consequences for local people for whom those same forests created homes and a source of livelihood. Mining operations poison rivers, bays and groundwater.
* Whole communities are displaced and their subsequent intrusion elsewhere can cause local wars in such elsewheres. Or can be used by politicians to frighten people and take control.
* Of course, this creates opportunities for a focus on developing war technology, sale or transfer of weapons, and entire military bases, joint military training, etc.
* Repeating colonialist mistakes. Believing we know better than local people. Intervening in a system we do not really know. Ignoring effects of our interventions, especially when staring us in the face. Denial.
* Distracting people by creating a focus on irrelevant threats. Dangerous move, what with the internet and more and more people becoming aware of the usual and commonly used political patterns. The internet may put enough of a stop that. Telephone had a great social impact. Let’s hope the internet makes a similar difference. How can I believe “others than us” are a threat if I have exchanged with “others” and found them to be very human, and not so “other” at all? When we refuse to believe authorities and conjured up “common enemies”, do not give our power away and think for ourselves? Fingers crossed.
* Climate change conferences, as if we can stop the climate changing. We can’t. Climate is always changing. Even if we could, is geoengineering the way to go? Intervening in yet another system we do not fully understand? Humans can influence the climate like we apparently already have. We are all in the same ship (living on the same planet) but are not equally responsible for influencing the climate. And are climate change treaties and emission markets maybe just another global power grab? ~500-700 new bureaucracies? New taxes? 2-5 percent levies on GDP? If cap-and-trade is used & “buying allowance” is done with inflationary currencies, does that mean that pollution inflates further too? Is this the new economic bubble? How many more displacements will result due to continued pillaging and plundering? The effects of that?
* A crashing UFO: Many effects remain overlooked, especially that the abstract wealth created for accumulation implies the destruction of nature as concrete wealth. The result is a “hole in the ground”, and next to it a garbage dump with used commodities, outdated machinery, and money without value. And when all concrete wealth (the last natural resource) is gone, so will abstract wealth. And the next generations (not just of humans, but all the other peoples on this planet)?
