In earlier times, who were those who "owned" the world and who were the have-nots? Why did one belong to one group or the other and what possibilities did one have to change that? The episode "From Field to Empire" is the first of three [Terra X episodes on this topic](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLc9110B1dmmyYZdfGkYPeZ3cas6WR2zkY).

And an alliance is formed that determines the fate of the world from then on: That of wealth and political power. As inseparable siblings, wealth and office rush from century to century. This is how biographies such as those of the Emperor Augustus and many of his successors on the Roman imperial throne came into being.
