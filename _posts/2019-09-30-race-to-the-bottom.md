Neoliberalism places property beyond the reach of democracy.

_Neoliberalism rules all but ensure that governments act in the interests of capital, since, if businesses do not like a certain country’s policies (say, a proposal that corporations pay their fair share of taxes), they can disrupt the economy by abruptly withdrawing from that country. Preserving the rights of capital is the goal, even when that means sacrificing democratic demands. That is why our world is a more neoliberal one than it once was, and why it matters. However fractious and internally contradictory neoliberal thought may be, and however overused it can be as a term, it is describing something real._

## Abstract wealth

The abstract concept of money has allowed people to become rich by depleting natural resources, marking up land prices, manipulating financial data, selling disposable goods, deliberately rendering products obsolete, pushing illegal drugs and exterminating species for body parts. Money doesn't discriminate between ethical and immoral activities, and many people don't care about the difference; in particular the ones setting the prices.

Abstract wealth may grow indefinitely (on paper and screens) but the real economy can only support a finite level of consumption and the environment can only support a finite level of very physical waste.
Transnational players

Transnational corporations appear to have formed a giant bow-tie structure with a large portion of control flowing to a small tightly-knit core of financial institutions.

_Nearly 4/10th of the control over the economic value of TNCs in the world is held, via a complicated web of ownership relations, by a group of 147 TNCs in the core, which has almost full control over itself. The top holders within the core can thus be thought of as an economic “super-entity” in the global network of corporations. A relevant additional fact at this point is that 3/4 of the core are financial intermediaries. ~ The network of global corporate control._

## Legalisation and lifting controls

The Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) is a 2008 program of the US, the latest in a series of programs and lifting of controls, in this case to address the sub-prime mortgage crisis by purchasing assets and equity from financial institutions to strengthen its financial sector. Under this “rationale” of “consolidating assets” (ed: more like a takeover) it is poisoning economic systems on the geopolitical level. Think of a Structural Adjustment Program (SAP) (ed: privatisation), but then worldwide, in which the International Monetary Fund (IMF) serves as facilitator of a “unified opening up of control” to private interests of globalists (ed: bye, bye, nations).

## Mechanisms

The mechanisms used are Quantitative easing, High frequency trading, Credit rating, Bail-outs and Bail-ins … Bail-ins happen for example when a bank confiscates private property in its own possession, to indemnify itself for losses it has suffered. It is a totally lawless theft of assets, as there is no principle of law (of any kind) which could authorise such a seizure of private property. As with much of this financial-crime jargon, it is simply another gibberish euphemism, like “quantitative easing” or “derivatives”. Continuing listing the mechanisms … Wash trade, Free market (that isn't really free), and High speed trading.
Governments

That part of it is a competitive race to the bottom that seems to go something like this:

* Cries of “don’t tax or regulate us too much or we’ll run away to Geneva!”
* Politicians in Country A quail and shower subsidies on them, in the desperate hope that they’ll stay.
* Country B thinks “if only we can offer them an even bigger subsidy, they’ll come here!” They do this, offering a corporate tax cut or loophole or a new financial regulatory wheeze, or a new union-crushing wage policy, or whatever.
* First country is then back to Square One, and has to wheel out still more goodies, to stay in the race.
* etc. etc. etc., ad nauseam.

## Overlooked

This race to the bottom leads to ever greater government handouts to capital and its owners, wealthy folk, multinational corporations, global banks, and so on – paid for by the sweat of everyone else. In the race to the bottom there seems to be no limit to which owners of capital would like to free-ride off the public goods provided by society. It is the nature of ideologies to see some things clearly and place other things out of view — to serve up a combination of useful concepts and to conceal self-interest.

_Sets of ideas that become influential can usually do a great deal of the latter. The point is surely not that neoliberalism is wrong about everything: It makes sense to seek to avoid hyperinflation, for example, and it is reasonable to note that price fluctuations in market economies provide information to consumers and business owners about how to behave—if apples become scarce, and their price goes up, consumers can substitute, say, cheaper oranges. And it certainly is possible, too, for political decisions to mangle an economy so that markets cease to perform their socially useful work. Venezuela, where the economy contracted 13 percent last year, as people suffered through shortages of medicine and food, is perhaps the most tragic example at the present moment._

_But the things that neoliberalism has trouble seeing are, at the present, far more consequential: deep inequalities, accompanied by a sense of powerlessness, of being left behind by a global system that operates with no regard for the interests or voice of the majority. Venezuela’s socialists wouldn’t have had their chance in power if not for the austerity imposed by neoliberal adjustment policies of the 1980s — policies that were met by popular protest that was suppressed by state violence. The rise of the far right in the United States and Europe cannot be explained solely as a reaction against neoliberal globalization (not least because many of its supporters are thriving economically), but the financial crisis of 2008 — caused by inadequate regulation — did give the far right its opportunity to grow._
