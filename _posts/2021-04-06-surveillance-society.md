These are some ingredients for one of five possible example [scenario narratives]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}scenario-planning):

## Plot

* A government steps in to protect its citizens from (potential) dissident and/or criminal actions and/or information that might “corrupt” its citizens.
* (Intelligence) Agencies use data-mining to identify (potential) individual dissidents and criminals.
* Government steps in to protect its individual citizens' privacy from being mined by non-state-actors and to create distraction from their own mining activities. Strong privacy regulations emerge.
* Citizens are increasingly being targeted in surveillance with surveillance tools purchased from China.

## Likely effects

* Organisations (Cartels, corporations, companies, NGO's) are restricted in their use of data.
* Consumerism is stifled.
* Governments will try to shift responsibility to individual citizens.
* Identity theft and ransomware boom.
* Individual citizens and citizen groups supported by NGO's call for “making the internet more safe (for children/women/dissidents)”.
* Governments try to regulate again and surveillance increases.
* Companies offering private and protected access to online services and make a lot of money.
* Mobile devices are closed and curated.
* Because people need to appear perfect to others, the need to appear perfect to oneself increases also (the cognitive dissonance is too painful). Acknowledging mistakes and failures and the feelings associated with them can be hard. 
* The surveillance society makes people have "negative emotions". The positive thinking movement encourages people to ignore their negative emotions. 
    * Negative emotions get buried in subconscious, resulting in mood swings, unexplained sadness, and mild depression, and eventually in aggression. 
    * Suppressing negative emotions may lead to depression, low self-esteem, and even physical illness in extreme cases.
    * Suppressing emotions is a risk factor in premature death, including death from cancer.
    * Negative emotions are dumped elsewhere on innocent people. NGO's will need more funding to respond with new/more support for women and children (at home) and dissidents (elsewhere).
    * Consciously constantly suppressing emotions can cause emotional numbness. It is common to hear the phrases "We live in stressful times" and "It is what it is" (with a shrug) and "You shouldn’t feel this way. Everything is alright. You need to be positive." 

## Measurables and observables

* The attack patterns may or may not have to do with psychogenic forces and deep states and include 
    * women and children more targeted more by teensy weensy petty tyrants, little petty tyrants and minor petty tyrants
    * human rights activists, journalists, land defenders, and political dissidents targeted more by petty tyrants. .
    * identity theft and ransomware attacks happening via automated botnets.
    * (Intelligence) Agencies increasingly using data-mining or bying data from brokers to identify "(potential) individual dissidents and criminals".
* The old EU Data Protection Directive of 1995 was outdated. It failed to cover for example, social networking sites, cloud computing, location-based services, smart cards and biometric data, and in 2012 the European Commission proposed a comprehensive reform of the EU’s data protection rules to strengthen privacy rights and boost Europe’s digital economy. Unlike directives, the new GDPR that came into force in 2018 does not require national governments to pass any enabling legislation. It is directly binding and applicable.
    * Note that the GDPR only addresses privacy concerns related to data processing by private sector and not by individual Member States. With the internet being a global network (driven by established interests), laws regarding for example, digital fingerprinting by intelligence agencies, may develop completely differently from one country to another regardless of raised concerns at the EU level as to the compatibility of such activities with human rights standards.
