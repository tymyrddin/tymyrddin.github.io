From the Middle East to Eastern Europe, there seems to be no shortage of engineered crises on the geopolitical chessboard these days? 

Thanks to scientific and technological advances, information has never been so voluminous, and so accessible, to so many people. ~ [Terror, climate chaos, financial crisis are the costs of ‘doing business’, Nafeez Ahmed, 2015](https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/terror-climate-chaos-financial-crisis-are-costs-doing-business

And the epistemological gap between our perceptions of the world and how we are affecting it remains as wide as ever. Sometimes, the gap is manufactured for political convenience. Senior US military commanders, for instance, have supposedly deliberately massaged intelligence to promote an image of victory in the war on the Islamic State (IS) while, according to the Daily Beast, more than 50 intelligence analysts working out of the U.S. military’s Central Command formally complained that their reports on ISIS and al Qaeda’s branch in Syria were being inappropriately altered by senior officials.

The gap is also related to deep-rooted geopolitical structures integral to the way the West interacts with the Muslim world. At the forefront of the US-led war on IS is a coalition of regional powers who over the past half-decade had siphoned arms and funds to the very militant groups in Syria that coalesced into IS. ~ [Islamic State arose from US support for al-Qaeda in Iraq, Nafeez Ahmed, 2015](https://medium.com/insurge-intelligence/officials-islamic-state-arose-from-us-support-for-al-qaeda-in-iraq-a37c9a60be4)

Intelligence documents reveal that despite knowing full well that their own allies – the Gulf states and Turkey – were empowering the most extremist Syrian rebel factions, Western governments continued to support them. No wonder Alain Chouet, former head of the Security Intelligence Service of the French Directorate-General for External Security (DGSE), has described the “War on Terror” as a “sham” concealing an ongoing “military alliance” between “Western governments and the financial sponsors of jihad … [W]e remain allies with those who have sponsored this terrorism for the last 30 years”. ~ [A thousand 9/11s, Nafeez Ahmed, 2015](https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/thousand-911s)
