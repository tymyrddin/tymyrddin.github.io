These are some ingredients for one of five possible example [scenario narratives]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/scenario-planning):

## Plot

This is a deviant (partly inductive) scenario, at least in terms of neo-liberal official futures.

* Individuals are increasingly targeted by governments and (nation-state or autonomous) hacker groups.
* Individuals are increasingly tracked and profiled.
* Government agencies of various sorts use the information to discover “dissidents”, “criminals” and “terrorists”.
* Businesses and data market companies use the information to influence the emotions and behaviour of individuals.
* Ineffective regulation.
* E-militias form.
* GNU licensed federated social media where users can operate safely within protective boundaries flourish.

A possible response of cartels is that they form their own protection societies for customers. Walled gardens providing anonymity and safety, with steep pricing. A possible response by governments is sicking armies of infiltrators (which may be sophisticated MLM bots) at citizens in the self-organised and corporate run gardens. 

## Likely effects

* Corporate reputations take a nose-dive, and so does “consumer” trust.
* Bubbles of like-minded people grow (not to be mistaken for filter-bubbles where an algorithm decides what's in and out of an individual's bubble). They trade, collaborate and converse between themselves. Trade between groups only happens for mutual beneficial actions or after sufficient trust levels have been established.
* Inequality grows.
* In low-income bubbles, E-commerce drops to an all time low. So does consumerism to a certain extent. This is also due to extremely low incomes, often way below the poverty line.
* Darknet grows.
* The desire for anonymity grows.
* Differences get slugged out between individuals and between groups.

## Measurables and observables

* Appearance of federated GNU licensed self-organising social media, tools like Mastodon, Peertube and research like Tracking Exposed and Citizen Lab.
* Appearance of articles like [Freedom Isn't Free, Wendy Liu](https://logicmag.io/failure/freedom-isnt-free/)
* Corporate run social media user bases like facebook, twitter, instagram and Youtube expand even further into other regions. 
* E-commerce growth rate initially explodes, shops in villages and smaller cities close.
* (Appearance of) Corporate or government run walled gardens.
