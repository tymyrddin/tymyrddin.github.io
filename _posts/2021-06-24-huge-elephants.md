The [UN Shared Rohingya Data Without Informed Consent](https://www.hrw.org/news/2021/06/15/un-shared-rohingya-data-without-informed-consent) putting the lives of over 800.000 people at risk.

The UN comments on that with a [Statement on refugee registration and data collection in Bangladesh](https://www.unhcr.org/en-us/news/press/2021/6/60c85a7b4/news-comment-statement-refugee-registration-data-collection-bangladesh.html)
