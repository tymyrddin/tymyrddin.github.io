Malware believed to be part of a nation-state espionage campaign and reminiscent of previous Red October attacks has been caught targeting mobile devices and PCs of executives, diplomats and military. It was discovered by Blue Coat Labs and named Inception and confirmed by Kaspersky Labs who named it CloudAtlas, and exploits flaws in Microsoft Windows and seeks to infect Android, Blackberry and iOS devices, but is limited to only infecting iPhones and iPads that are jailbroken.

Targets of this campaign, inferred by the content of phishing emails include executives from oil, finance and engineering, military officers, embassy personnel and government officials. While the attacks initially aimed at individuals in Russia and other Eastern European countries, its scope has widened to include executives in the oil and energy industry in Romania, Venezuela, and Mozambique.

The Inception malware poses as a WhatsApp app update, and was packaged as a Debian installer package that “impersonates a Cydia installer, and can only be installed on a jailbroken phone.” The attack has evolved (from its first appearance in 2013, when it was named “Red October” by Kaspersky Labs), now posing as the increasingly popular WhatsApp rather than Microsoft's Skype.

Depending on device, the malware collects unique device identifiers such as device's serial and phone number, carrier information and activity, such as calls logs and contacts, memory use and other status information and the names of apps iTunes has installed. To reach potential victims, the attackers devised MMS phishing campaigns through at least 60 mobile networks across the globe.
