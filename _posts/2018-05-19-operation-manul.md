Operation Manul was most likely carried out on behalf of the government of Kazakhstan. 

[EFF research](https://www.eff.org/files/2018/01/29/operation-manul.pdf) suggests links between this campaign and other campaigns that have been attributed to an Indian security company called Appin Security Group. There may also be possible links between this campaign and Arcanum Global Intelligence, a private intelligence company with headquarters in Zurich. 

Operation Manul targeted journalists, dissidents living in Europe, their family members, known associates, and their lawyers.
