From the There-is-much-much-more-to-it Dept.

Equifax, one of the largest credit bureaus in the U.S., said that an application vulnerability on one of their websites led to a data breach that exposed about 143 million consumers. The breach was discovered on July 29, but the company says that it likely started in mid-May. In October 2017, Equifax raised its estimate of the number of impacted consumers to 145.5 million. Then, on March 1, 2018, the company raised the number by another 2.4 million, bringing the tally to 147.9 million.

The company stated records containing Social Security Numbers, birth dates, addresses, and in some cases driver's license numbers were accessed, 209,000 consumers also had their credit card data exposed and for 182,000 consumers the breach also included “certain dispute documents with personal identifying information”.

* Equifax launched a website named [equifaxsecurity2017.com](https://www.equifaxsecurity2017.com/) for those potentially impacted.
* Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Richard F. Smith made an apology: “This is clearly a disappointing event for our company, and one that strikes at the heart of who we are and what we do. I apologize to consumers and our business customers for the concern and frustration this causes.”
* The company has hired a forensics firm to help with the investigation and offer guidance on preventing such a data breach from happening again.
* Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Richard F. Smith: “I’ve told our entire team that our goal can’t be simply to fix the problem and move on. Confronting cybersecurity risks is a daily fight. While we’ve made significant investments in data security, we recognize we must do more. And we will.”

And that is not where the story ends:

* US Congress voted to disallow consumers from suing Equifax and other companies with arbitration agreements, Oct 24, 2017
* Senators push to ditch Social Security numbers in light of Equifax hack, Nov 08, 2017
* Equifax launches its credit locking app and extends free credit freezes through June, Jan 31, 2018
* Equifax filing reveals hack was somehow even worse than previous estimates, May 08, 2018: _The 2017 hack of Equifax, already among the largest ever recorded, just got bigger. Well, they’re admitting that it was bigger than they had previously, which amounts to the same thing. Documents filed with the SEC reveal that more people, more IDs, and more info in general was stolen when the company utterly failed to protect its “users,” many of which didn’t even know they were in the database._

The company revealed various numbers around the time it disclosed the hack, though one it neglected to include was how many millions of dollars in stock were sold by executives before publicly disclosing it. But let’s not linger on their past crimes. I’m sure they’re very sorry!
