States are increasingly launching non-lethal attacks against an enemy’s information systems and people – this is the rise of information warfare. Not only is it a geopolitical “game”, states are also attacking their own people for maintaining dominance, corporations do to get you to buy their stuff, political groups are attacking other political groups for believing in something else, and individuals take out their frustration on others.

Information warfare may involve collection of tactical information, assurance(s) that one's own information is valid, spreading of propaganda or disinformation to demoralize or manipulate the enemy and the public, undermining the quality of opposing force information and denial of information-collection opportunities to opposing forces.

Information warfare is closely linked to psychological warfare. In the big, and often also, in the small. Therefore researching the patterns of psychological warfare is easy. One can simply observe them in oneself and in ones own circles. For example, the myth of technological sufficiency that many depending on the system seem to believe in, identifies technology as the critical factor to solve any issue. Yet more technology is not likely to end any large scale warfare.
