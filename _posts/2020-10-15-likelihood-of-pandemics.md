It is not just SARS-COv-2 (Corona). In general there is an increased likelihood of pandemics in the future due to:

* Increased exposure to non-human pathogens if we
    * Increase meat consumption
    * Continue to encroach on natural areas
    * Continue to allow exotic animal trade
* Globalisation - It takes only 40 hours to circumnavigate the world by plane, 40 days by boat and 346 days by foot. People, products, capital and disease-causing microorganisms travel the world with unprecedented quantity and speed.
* Urbanisation - Concentration of populations in major cities and increased international air travel are creating conditions ripe for pandemics to spread faster and infect more people. A contagion most likely starts at major airports, brought into the country by international travellers and happens most likely in two waves, first concentrating in major cities before spreading out to the rest of a country in a second wave.
* Climate change because of
    * Expansion of vector ranges, spreading diseases like malaria via mosquitoes to human populations.
    * Increased temperature ranges and flooding, which can mobilise waterborne pathogens like Cholera.
* Increased antimicrobial resistance (AMR), which can involve bacteria becoming resistant to antibiotics.
* Increased [inequality]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/tags/#inequality) and [poverty]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/tags/#poverty) causing people to not have the healthcare they need.
