The problem of mental causation is a conceptual issue in the philosophy of mind, surrounding the idea of mind as an immaterial substance. Ever since Descartes advanced the notion of a radical substance dualism where the mind and body are two fundamentally distinct things, the mind (immaterial) and the body (material), there has been an ongoing argument against the notion that an immaterial mind cannot interact with a material body. 

## Computational theories of mind

The information technology solution to the body-mind problem can be interpreted as providing a non-reductive physical interpretation of mind. This model of mind supervenes on the neural brain structures that embody the information (while it is being stored). But the selected content of the information is not the resultant of whatever physical processes are coming from lower layers in a hierarchical structure. The physical brain is a storage medium adequately determined to store the information content of these immaterial thoughts, and normally to store it accurately.

With reference to popular (if flawed) computational theories of mind, we note that the software contents of a computer program, as well as the execution of the program, is in no way determined or caused by the computer hardware. Similarly, ideas are not determined by the ink on a printed page or the pixels on a computer screen, but by the human minds that put them there, and by the human minds that selectively take note of the ideas. 

## Determinism 

According to classical models, in any given atom, the nucleus contains 99.9% of the mass of the entire atom and its diameter is only 1/100,000th of the surrounding electron cloud. Given that the size of the entire atom is determined by the orbit of the outermost electron the atom is then 99.9999999999999% open space. The classic model is deterministic, meaning, you can predict its movements.

In quantum mechanics, electrons are not deterministic particles like they are in classical mechanics. An atomic orbital is a mathematical function that describes the wave-like behaviour of either one electron or a pair of electrons in an atom. This function can be used to calculate the probability of finding any electron of an atom in any specific region around the atom's nucleus. 

## Bell test

In 1935, Einstein asked a profound question about our understanding of Nature: are objects only influenced by their nearby environment? Or could, as predicted by quantum theory, looking at one object sometimes instantaneously affect another far-away object (he referred to it as spooky action at a distance)?

A Bell test is a real-world physics experiment designed to test the theory of quantum mechanics in relation to two other concepts: the principle of locality and Einstein's concept of local realism. The experiments test whether or not the real world satisfies local realism, which requires the presence of some additional local variables to explain the behaviour of particles like photons and electrons. According to Bell's theorem, if nature actually operates in accord with any theory of local hidden variables, then the results of a Bell test will be constrained in a particular, quantifiable way. If a Bell test is performed in a laboratory and the results are not thus constrained, then they are inconsistent with the hypothesis that local hidden variables exist. Such results would support the position that there is no way to explain the phenomena of quantum mechanics in terms of a more fundamental description of nature that is more in line with the rules of classical physics.

In 2015, the Hanson Lab successfully performed a loophole-free Bell test. We are not living in a super-deterministic world! (as if we didn't know that).

## Moving on

If, as described in quantum mechanics, the indeterminacy of individual particles gets averaged over when large numbers of indeterministic particles get together in chemically or gravitationally bound aggregates and macroscopic adequately deterministic laws “emerge”, physical brain events are not pre-determined by the events in lower hierarchical levels. This implies that not everything can be explained by (reduced to) the basic laws of physics and the world is not causally closed.

Since some “mental events” are large enough information structures to be adequately determined, these mental events can act causally on lower biological and physical levels in the hierarchy, in particular, the mind can move the body and all its contained physical particles, and the mind-body problem is solved. But the debat is not, or the attempts at creating yet another intersubjective mythos.

## #$*!

What the Bleep Do We Know!? (stylized as What tнē #$*! D̄ө ωΣ (k)πow!? and What the #$*! Do We Know!?) is a 2004 American film that combines documentary-style interviews, computer-animated graphics, and a narrative that posits a spiritual connection between quantum physics and consciousness. The plot follows the fictional story of a photographer as she encounters emotional and existential obstacles in her life and begins to consider the idea that individual and group consciousness can influence the material world. Her experiences are offered by the filmmakers to illustrate the film's thesis about quantum physics and consciousness.
