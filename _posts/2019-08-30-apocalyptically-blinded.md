Blinded to the apocalypse, or blinded by it?

In 1956, the Jewish-German philosopher Günther Anders developed a philosophical anthropology on the technological and moral challenges of his time. Anders suggested the societal changes that arose with the industrial age opened a gap between the capability of individuals to produce machines and their ability to imagine and deal with the consequences caused by this capability. He argues that a ‘Promethean gap’ manifests in academic and scientific thinking and leads to an extensive trivialization of societal issues. In the face of climate change, Anders’ philosophical anthropology contributes substantially to our attempts to fight climate change with innovation. Anders' description of ‘apocalyptic blindness’ helps us to explain why we cannot help pairing our belief in historical progress and growth with our ideas on social and environmental justice. With that said, this paper contributes to the debate on humanity ‘after sustainability’ by calling to mind Anders’ historical theory on the outdatedness of humankind and his thoughts on our lack of imagination. ~ [On the obsolescence of human beings in sustainable development, Ulrike Ehgartner, Patrick Gould & Marc Hudson, 2017](https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/files/56722464/Author_Accepted_Manuscript_Anders.pdf)

And a reply to that paper:

“…In this short response, we will raise some questions with regard to (1) apocalyptic blindness and (2) the apocalyptically blind. Firstly, as compelling as Anders’ critique is with respect to the atomic bomb, one needs to ask whether it holds in the same way with respect to climate change. We think that something has changed in recent decades, which is also captured in debates centred on the concept of ‘the anthropocene’, which we take to denote a vision of our capacity to self-destruct – certainly a capacity to profoundly change our environment to a degree that registers on geological and evolutionary scales. In 2016, the problem is not that we cannot imagine the apocalypse, it is that we cannot imagine a way out of it” … “Hence we could say that, rather than being blind to the apocalypse, we are now blinded by it; blinded so we cannot see a way out.” ~ [Apocalyptically blinded, Nina Isabella Moeller & J. Martin Pedersen, 2017](https://pure.coventry.ac.uk/ws/portalfiles/portal/26168892/Binder1.pdf)
