Most of us believe we perceive reality as it generally is, with perhaps some slight distortions. But mathematical models based on natural selection suggest that our strongest intuitions may be false.

Scientific investigations of consciousness that seeks biological basis typically assume that objects in space-time—such as neurons—exist even if unperceived, and have causal powers. [Donald Hoffman](https://www.cogsci.uci.edu/~ddhoff/) evaluates this assumption, using evolutionary games and genetic algorithms that study perceptual evolution, and finds that it is almost surely false. 

What is the difference between math all the way down and elephants (turtles) all the way down?
If space-time is doomed then is causality doomed as well? What is next?
