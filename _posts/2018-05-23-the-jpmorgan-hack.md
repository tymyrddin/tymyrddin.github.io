From the Through-the-looking-glass Dept.

August of 2014, supposedly Russian hackers attacked the U.S. financial system in retaliation against U.S. government-sponsored sanctions aimed at Russia. The bank made it known via an [SEC 8-K filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/19617/000119312514362173/d799478d8k.htm) that the breach affected 76 million households and 7 million small businesses. They confirmed that contact information of customers was compromised in the breach including name, address, phone number and email addresses and that internal JP Morgan information pertaining to customers such as credit cards and various investment products, was also accessed by parties unknown.

Additionally, the New York Times, reported at least four other firms in addition to JP Morgan were hit in the same month by co-ordinated attacks that siphoned off huge amounts of data, including checking and savings account information.

In 2015, [a worldwide hacking ring](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-11-10/hackers-accused-by-u-s-of-targeting-top-banks-mutual-funds) is broken up and information on a vast, multi-year criminal enterprise centering on hacks of at least nine big financial and publishing firms appears, in involving the theft of information on 100 million of their customers that fuelled a web of stock manipulation, credit-card fraud and illegal online casinos. Two indictments from the US tied three of four suspects to previously reported hacks of JP Morgan Chase, E*Trade Financial, Scottrade Financial Services, and Dow Jones, a unit of News Corporation.

In 2016, the only American suspect in the JP Morgan Chase hack is negotiating his return to the U.S. from a detention cell in Russia, where he is no longer welcome. A Russian judge ordered Aaron deported and fined him 5,000 rubles ($80) for violating the rules of his three-year visa, which requires holders to exit and re-enter the country every six months. Aaron arrived via Ukraine on May 23, 2015 â€“ just weeks before the U.S. issued arrest warrants for him and co-defendants Gery Shalon and Ziv Orenstein. A second judge rejected his appeal of the deportation ruling in June 2016.

The fourth hacker remains a mystery.
