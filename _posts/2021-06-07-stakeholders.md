Stakeholders are those without whom an organisation would not exist, and all of the stakeholders have to find their seat at the table. Just keep your eye on developing meaningful relationships to discover expectations, needs, wants and desires. Then work backwards from there while solving problems when they occur. Sounds simple doesn't it? It isn't. The models are flawed, and so are people (with respect to your models). 

More seriously (and I promise no vampire jokes) ...

## Stakeholder analysis

Stakeholder analysis is about the identification of who is impacted by which decisions. Even if one thinks all "stakeholders" are properly identified (impossible), the analysis is most likely academic, and can hide the fact that there may be no real interest in the stakeholders or the impact on them of decisions made.

In strategic models, stakeholders who hold the highest degree of influence in the organisation are identified and inducted into decision-making processes. These stakeholders are acknowledged to the extent that they affect shareholders (for example governmental markets), but the interests of the stakeholders themselves remain secondary. Decisions are made to serve shareholder interests before anyone else’s, a strongly biased process.

## Stakeholder synthesis

In multi-fiduciary type of stakeholder theories all stakeholders are considered to be fiduciaries in the organisation. A government may invest money in a market, and its contractors invest time and energy. A problem may occur when some people seem to have reservations about treating those who do not invest money in the organisation in the same manner as those who do.

First line contractors must receive fair compensations for their work and the risks they take, and subcontractors must also be able to run their own businesses and cooperatives, the concerns of the government must be met, and the (social) media must receive transparency from the organisation as far as is reasonable. Often forgotten are local communities and environment as stakeholders.

## Making magic

Stakeholders in a market will expect some form of compensation for their contribution within the organisation for such a change program, for example they will expect better working conditions and/or more diversity within the organisation, a better income, or having more choices and/or being more involved in decision making. Expectations can vary between individuals and cooperatives (and individuals within cooperatives). Where changes may affect people within the organisation and the possibility of "underpay" is perceived, the result can cause sufficient discomfort. This can be enough for people to switch allegiances or alter their expectations for making the magic happen.

## Common problems

And even if that doesn't happen there are still some common problems that can occur.

### Lack of congruence
A lack of congruence can create its own set of stakeholder problems. If some people are focused on getting as many people as possible to use the market’s possibilities, while first line contractors have a mission to focus on the quality of service and one-on-one relationships, the first will want to do more promotion to get a wider variety of clients and/or subcontractors (for reducing dependency risks), while the latter will want to stay focused on outreach to get the right types of projects from the existing market.

### Stakeholder legitimacy
When a specific stakeholder's activities are not in line with an organisation’s values and norms, there can be a stakeholder legitimacy problem. This type of problem often occurs during a single isolated event that does not align with the organisation's mission.

### Organisational legitimacy
In an organisational legitimacy problem, the organisation as a whole violates the norms and values of its external stakeholders. This can impact the market and the reputation of the organisation, as well as all the other people supported by it.

### Differences
The generational gap and differing expectations and motivations can create problems. Older generations may have seen commitment to an organisation as a long-term relationship, and take part in additional activities out of a sense of duty to the whole. Younger generations may wish to get involved in short-term commitments and could be much more motivated by what they can gain from that experience. 

And not just generational differences may play a role. In a world that is changing rapidly and in which the inequality gap grows (also see [Boots Theory of Socioeconomic Unfairness](https://samvimesbootstheory.com/) by Vimes), people may even have to reinvent themselves and their skills multiple times in a life time just to survive (and still have wet feet). 

Each stakeholder’s approach and commitment will be different and this is another potential source of conflicts.
